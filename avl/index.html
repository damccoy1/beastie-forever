<h2> Glossary

Here are some terms that are used when discussing <i>AVL</i> trees:
<br/>

<ul>

<li>

 <b>child</b> -- same as for binary search trees
</li>

<li>

 <b>parent</b> -- same as for binary search trees
</li>

<li>

 <b>leaf</b> -- same as for binary binary search trees
</li>

<li>

 <b>grandparent</b> -- parent of parent
</li>

<li>

 <b>favorite</b> --the child who roots the taller subtree -
if the parent's balance factor is 1, the left child is the
favorite --
if the parent's balance factore is -1, the right child is
the favorite --
if the parent's balance factor is 0, no child is the favorite
</li>

<li>

 <b>linear</b> -- true if the parent and child are both left children or
are both right children
</li>

<li>

 <b>rotation</b> -- make a child a parent and the former parent a child
-- preserves binary search tree ordering
</li>

</ul>


Note that terms like
<i>favorite</i> and <i>linear</i>
are not found in other <i>AVL</i> search tree
descriptions.
They are used here in order to remove leftness and rightness issues from the main
<i>AVL</i> tree algorithms.

<h2> <i>AVL</i> properties
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

An <i>AVL</i> tree has the following properties:
<br/>

<ul>

<li>


Leaves have a balance factor of zero
</li>

<li>


Interior nodes have a balance factor of -1, 0, or 1
</li>

</ul>


The <i>balance factor</i> marks which child is the root of the taller
subtree and is computed by subtracting the height of the right child's
subtree from the height of the left child's subtree. This means that
an <i>AVL</i> tree is nearly as balanced as it can be with just a little
bit of slop allowed.
<a href="http://beastie.cs.ua.edu/red-black">
<i>Red-black</i> trees,
</a> on the other hand, allow a good deal more slop with regards to
balance.
