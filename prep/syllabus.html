<br/>
Make sure you read the assigned material, work any exercises, and
explore answering any questions prior to class.
<br/>
<!-- section -->
<h2> Grading
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

You will be given a minimum of eight exams; your grade will be based upon
the highest score achieved on an individual exam.
Exams will be given starting the third week of class.
<br/>
<br/>
Each unexcused absence (after the first) will result in a plus/minus deduction.
<br/>
<!-- section -->
<h2> Other Details
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

The following conventions will be followed in the course. Please make sure
that you fully understand each of the items listed below.
<br/>

<ul>

<li>

 An absence will be excused if you alert your instructor
prior to the start of the class you will be missing.
To do so, send an email with the subject similar to:

<pre>
    ENGR 191 ABSENCE 1/18
</pre>

If you do not inform your instructor before the start of a missed
class via email, you will need to
provide a written, university authorized excuse. Note: the email
only excuses you from the absence penalty. It does not excuse you
from an exam.

<br/>
<br/>

</li>

<li>

 Please be in your seat by the beginning of class. There is to be no
food or drink in the classroom. Sleep is allowed only in the event of a
stultifyingly boring lecture.

<br/>
<br/>

</li>

<li>

 I will ignore all requests for extra credit or for individual treatment
that would be unfair to other students.

<br/>
<br/>

</li>

<li>

 Signing up for and keeping current with the ENGR191 Forum at
<a href="http://beastie.cs.ua.edu/forum/forumdisplay.php?fid=12" style="font-size:10px,font-family:'Lucida Console',monospace">http://beastie.cs.ua.edu/forum/forumdisplay.php?fid=12</a>
is mandatory.
Schedule changes, assignment clarifications, and such will be announced
via the forum.
Registrations will not be allowed after the fifth class meeting.

<br/>
<br/>

</li>

<li>

 The University of Alabama Code of Academic Conduct
will be rigorously enforced.
Please review the code at
<a href="http://www.studenthandbook.ua.edu/academicintegritypolicies.html" style="font-size:10px,font-family:'Lucida Console',monospace">http://www.studenthandbook.ua.edu/academicintegritypolicies.html</a>
and be sure to follow this Code in all activities associated with ENGR191.
Any violations of this code will be handled as an Academic Misconduct case.
The minimum punishment requested for plagiarism,
or any other academic misconduct, is
dismissal from the class with a failing grade. You are required to
protect your work from plagiarism. If your work is plagiarized, it will
be assumed that you were a willing participant in the plagiarism and
you will receive the same punishment as the plagiarist, absent extraordinary
evidence to the contrary.
</li>

</ul>
