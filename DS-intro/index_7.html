<h1>Circular Arrays</h1>

<h2><a name="id1">Synopsis</a></h2><p>
A circular array is like a fillable array except values can be added
to and removed from the
front of the store as well as the back.
A consequence of this is the front element of the store
may have an associated index other than zero.
To avoid shifting elements when adding an element to the front of
the store, indices are allowed to <i>roll over</i>.
For example, suppose the capacity is 10 and the size is 5,
with the first element residing at index 0 (using zero-based
counting). Adding a new value to the front should place it
at index -1, which does not exist. Since the index is too small
(<i>i.e.</i>, negative),
the capacity is added to the index to
make it non-negative. For our example, the new index is -1 plus
10, or 9. Thus the new element is added at index 9, the rightmost
slot.
Conversely, with the same size and capacity as before,
but with the index of the first element being 5, consider
adding an element to the back. In this
case, the index of the most rightmost element is 9, because the size is
5 (the five values are stored at indices 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9).
Adding an element at the back would place it
at index 10, which does not exist. Since the index is
too large, the proper index is
then computed by subtracting off the capacity. The places
the to-be-added element at index 0.
The tests for indices being too small or too large can
be eliminated by the use of modular arithmetic.
</p>
<p>As with
<a href="index_6.html">fillable arrays</a>
circular arrays use a normal
array as a store.
</p>

<h2><a name="CircularArraysStructure">Structure</a></h2>
<p>The typical circular array object has three components plus
a set of operators:
</p>
<pre>
    class circular-array
        {
        var store = ?;      //points to an array
        var capacity = ?;   //length of the store
        var size = 0;       //net number of elements added
        var startIndex = 0; //index of the first/leftmost element
        var endIndex = 0;   //optional: index of the first open slot
        //operations
        ...
        }
</pre>
<p>The <i>store</i> component points to a normal array and is set by the
constructor. The <i>capacity</i> is usually given as an argument to the
constructor and is used to allocate the <i>store</i>.
Both the start and end indices are set to zero; the only case
when these indices are equal is when the circular array is empty.
</p>

<h2><a name="CircularArraysVocabulary">Vocabulary</a></h2>
<p>The terms used in describing a circular array,
in addition to those of
<a href="index_5.html#ArraysVocabulary">normal arrays</a>,
are:
</p>
<dl><dt>start index</dt><dd>
The index of the first element in the store.
When computing a new start index, if the result is too large,
it is corrected by subtracting off the capacity. If it becomes
to small (<i>e.g.</i>, negative for zero-based counting),
it is corrected by adding in the capacity.
</dd><dt>end index</dt><dd>
The index of the first open slot in the store.
It is computed dynamically by adding the size to the start index.
If the generated index is too large,
it is corrected by subtracting off the capacity.
The end index may also be cached as a component of the data structure.
</dd><dt>index correction</dt><dd> 
The process of correcting an index if it is too small or
too large. A convenient method of correction uses modular
arithmetic.
</dd><dt>modular arithmetic</dt><dd>
A calculated index, whether it be too
small or two large, can be corrected by adding in the capacity and 
then <i>modding</i> by the capacity. If the calculated index was
neither too small or too large, the operations of adding in the
capacity and then modding has no effect.
</dd></dl>

<h2><a name="id4">Supports</a></h2><p>
Circular arrays can be used to implement:
</p>
<ul><li><a href="index_13.html">Bounded Stacks with a <i>least-recently-pushed</i> replacement
strategy</a>
</li><li><a href="index_14.html">Bounded Queues</a>
</li></ul>
<p>Circular arrays are used as a basis for:
</p>
<ul><li><a href="index_9.html">Dynamic Circular Arrays</a>
</li></ul>

<h2><a name="id5">Dependencies</a></h2><p>
Circular arrays are implemented using <a href="index_5.html">arrays</a>,
with similarities to <a href="index_6.html">fillable arrays</a>.
</p>

<h2><a name="id6">Operations</a></h2>

<h3><a name="id7">decrement-index</a></h3><p>
This operation subracts one from the given index. If
the resulting value becomes too small, the value is
corrected by adding in the capacity. In any case,
the new, perhaps corrected, value is returned.
</p>
<p>This operation is generally a private method.
</p>

<h3><a name="id8">increment-index</a></h3><p>
Like <i>decrement-index</i>, except one is added to
the given index (with possible correction).
</p>
<p>This operation is generally a private method.
</p>

<h3><a name="id9">correct</a></h3><p>
The <i>increment</i> and <i>decrement</i> operations can be
replaced with this operation which typically
uses modular arithmetic to adjust the given index.
The calls:
</p>
<pre>
    u = decrementIndex(v)
    x = incrementIndex(y)
</pre>
<p>would be replaced with:
</p>
<pre>
    u = correctIndex(v - 1);
    x = correctIndex(y + 1);
</pre>
<p>This operation is generally a private method.
</p>

<h3><a name="id10">add-to-front</a></h3><p>
This operation adds a given <i>value</i> to the front of
the store. A special case exists if the array is empty.
If so, <i>add-to-back</i> is called to handle the addition.
Otherwise, the start index is decremented and corrected,
if necessary.
</p>
<pre>
    function add-to-front(value)
        {
        if (size == 0)
            add-to-back(value)
        else
            {
            startIndex = decrementIndex(startIndex);
            store[startIndex] = value;
            size += 1;
            }
        }
</pre>
<p>Adding an element to the front takes <i>&#920;(1)</i> time.
</p>

<h3><a name="id11">add-to-back</a></h3><p>
This operation adds a given <i>value</i> to the back of
the store. Unlike fillable arrays, the next available slot may not
have index <i>size</i>. The start index is added to the
<i>size</i> to generate the actual index of the next available
slot. The generated index is corrected, if necessary.
</p>
<pre>
    function add-to-back(value)
        {
        store[endIndex] = value;
        endIndex = incrementIndex(endIndex)
        size += 1;
        }
</pre>
<p>Adding an element to the back takes <i>&#920;(1)</i> time.
</p>

<h3><a name="id12">remove-from-front</a></h3><p>
This operation removes the leftmost <i>value</i> in the store.
This can be done simply by incrementing the start index
(with correction). The size component is updated
accordingly.
</p>
<p>Removing the front element takes <i>&#920;(1)</i> time.
</p>

<h3><a name="id13">remove-from-back</a></h3><p>
This operation removes the rightmost <i>value</i> in the store.
This can be done simply by decrementing the size, if the
end index is not cached. If the end index is cached, it
needs to be decremented (with correction) as well.
</p>
<p>Removing the back element takes <i>&#920;(1)</i> time.
</p>

<h3><a name="id14">get, set</a></h3><p>
Like
<a href="index_6.html#FillableArraysGet">fillable arrays</a>,
a valid index
for <i>get</i> and <i>set</i> lies between 0 and <i>size</i> - 1.
However, the value of the start index must be added to the
given index and then corrected as necessary. For example,
<i>get</i> becomes:
</p>
<pre>
    function get(index)
        {
        var spot = correctIndex(index + startIndex);
        return store[spot];
        }
</pre>
<p>The code for <i>set</i> follows a similar pattern.
</p>

<h3><a name="id15">find</a></h3><p>
Find is similar to that of 
<a href="index_6.html#FillableArraysFind">fillable arrays</a>.
Assuming the 
elements are unsorted, a modified linear
traversal (see below) is used.
</p>

<h2><a name="CircularArrayTraversals">Traversals</a></h2>
<p>Circular arrays support traversals similar to that of arrays,
except that the actual starting (or ending) point is the start index
while the actual ending (or starting point) is the end index.
However, since the end index  may be smaller than the start index,
it becomes difficult to write a loop based upon these actual values.
By basing the traversal on <i>get</i> (or <i>set</i>), then
the starting (or ending) point is zero and
the ending (or starting point) is the <i>size</i> - 1
and writing such a traversing loop is greatly simplified:
</p>
<pre>
    for (i = 0; i &lt; size; i += 1)
        println(get(i));
</pre>
<p>A right-to-left traversal is similar.
</p>
