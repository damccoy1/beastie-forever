<h1>Singly Linked-Lists</h1>

<h2><a name="id1">Synopsis</a></h2><p>
A linked-list is one of the more important data structures in
computer science, having a wide application in a number of
situations. Linked-listes are usually constructed from nodes,
each node having a single node pointer.
The nodes are chained together with this node pointer. For
example, if the node pointer is named next and the variable
a points to the first node in the chain, the subsequent nodes
in the chain
could be accessed with the expressions:
</p>
<pre>
    a.next;             //the second node
    a.next.next;        //the third node
    a.next.next.next;   //the fourth node
</pre>
<p>Pictorially, a linked-list is often represented with
a box-and-pointer diagram, where each box represents
a node and where a downward arrow represents a value
pointer and a rightward arrow represents the next node
pointer:
</p>
<div align="center">
<img alt="" src="list.png"/>
</div>
<p>To improve performance when adding a new element to the rear of
the list, a tail pointer can be used. The tail pointer is
set to always point to the last node in the list:
</p>
<div align="center">
<img alt="" src="listtail.png"/>
</div>

<h2><a name="id2">Structure</a></h2>
<pre>
    class singly-linked-list
        {
        var head = null;        //pointer to the first/leftmost node
        var tail = null;        //optional: pointer to last/rightmost node
        var size = 0;           //optional: holds net number of nodes added
        // operations
        ...
        }
</pre>

<h2><a name="SinglyLinkedListsVocabulary">Vocabulary</a></h2>
<p>The terms used in describing an singly linked-list are:
</p>
<dl><dt>chain</dt><dd>
A series of nodes linked using a single node pointer
</dd><dt>head of the list</dt><dd>
The first/leftmost value stored in the list.
</dd><dt>tail of the list</dt><dd>
The list minus the first/leftmost node.
</dd><dt>head pointer</dt><dd>
A component of the list that points to
the first/leftmost node in the list. When the list is
empty, the head pointer has a value of null.
The head pointer serves as the data structure's store.
</dd><dt>tail pointer</dt><dd>
An additional component of the list that points to
the last/rightmost node in the list.
When using a tail pointer, it is imperative to
remember to set the tail pointer to null whenever
and however a list becomes empty.
</dd><dt>index</dt><dd>
An index is an integer value used to indicate a particular
node in the list. The first node has index 0, the second has
index 1, and so on.
</dd><dt>size</dt><dd>
The number of nodes in the list. Also called <i>length</i>.
<a name="SinglyLinkedListsDummy"></a>
</dd><dt>dummy head node</dt><dd>
A device to simplify the add-to-front operation. A dummy node
is a node with no value. When using a dummy head node,
the head pointer always points to this node,
even if the list is empty. The first/leftmost node follows
the dummy head node. The size of the list does not include
the dummy head node.
</dd><dt>walking a list</dt><dd> 
Traversing the list, usually from the head node to
the tail node.
</dd><dt>link</dt><dd>
A node in the list is often called a <i>link</i>.
</dd></dl>

<h2><a name="id5">Supports</a></h2><p>
Singly linked-lists are used as a basis for:
</p>
<ul><li><a href="index_13.html">stacks</a>
</li><li><a href="index_15.html">pritority queues</a>
</li></ul>
<p>If a tail pointer is implemented, then a singly linked-list
can be used as a basis for a 
<a href="index_14.html">queue</a>.
</p>

<h2><a name="id6">Dependencies</a></h2><p>
Singly linked-lists are implemented using
<a href="index_10.html">nodes</a>.
with a single node pointer, typically named <i>next</i>.
</p>

<h2><a name="id7">Operations</a></h2>

<h3><a name="id8">add-to-front</a></h3><p>
The <i>add-to-front</i> operation is quite simple. It simply points
the head to a new node whose <i>next</i> pointer points to the
old head:
</p>
<pre>
    function add-to-front(value)
         {
         head = new node(value,head);
         }
</pre>
<p>However, if the list incorporates a dummy head node,
the <i>add-to-front</i> function becomes:
</p>
<pre>
    function add-to-front(value)
         {
         head.next = new-node(value,head.next);
         }
</pre>
<p>If a tail pointer is used, the tail pointer must
be set the newly created node if the list was
empty prior to the addition.
</p>
<p>This operation takes <i>&#920;(1)</i> time.
</p>

<h3><a name="id9">add-to-back</a></h3><p>
Without a tail pointer, adding to the back involves
traversing the list, stopping at the last node.
Then a new node is added:
</p>
<pre>
    function add-to-back(value)
        {
        if (is-empty())
            add-to-front(value);
        else
            {
            var last = get-last-node();
            last.next = new-node(value,null);
            }
        }
</pre>
<p>If the list is empty, then an <i>add-to-front</i> is performed
to make sure the head pointer is updated properly.
Otherwise,
the <i>get-last-node</i> function is tasked with the job of
walking the list, starting at the head, and returning the last node
in the list. As written, <i>add-to-back</i>
takes <i>&#920;(n)</i> time, due to the cost of
the <i>get-last-node</i> function.
</p>
<p>However, if a tail pointer is used, this operation can
be reduced to <i>&#920;(1)</i> time since the last node
in the list is cached. When adding to the back,
care must be taken to update the tail pointer to
the new node.
</p>

<h3><a name="id10">remove-from-front</a></h3><p>
Removing from the front updates the head pointer
to point to the head's next pointer. In the case
of a dummy head node, the dummy's next pointer
is updated.
</p>
<p>If a tail pointer is used, a check must be made
if the list becomes empty. If so, the tail
pointer should be set to null.
</p>
<p>This operation takes <i>&#920;(1)</i> time.
</p>

<h3><a name="id11">remove-from-back</a></h3><p>
If the size of the list is one, then this operation
should call remove-from-front to ensure a newly empty list
is dealt with properly. Otherwise,
one must walk to list to find the next to the last node
and set its next pointer to null. If a tail pointer is
kept, it is set to the new "last" node.
</p>
<p>This operation takes <i>&#920;(n)</i> time, regardless of
whether a tail pointer is kept or not.
</p>

<h3><a name="id12">insert-at-index</a></h3><p>
Inserting at a given index entails walking the list.
With each step, the index is reduced by one. When
the index reaches one (using zero-based counting),
a new node containing the given value is inserted
between the current node, and the node after the
current node. Care must be taken so that all
pointers are updated correctly. A special case
occurs when the given index is zero. If so,
<i>add-to-front</i> is called instead of performing
the walk and subsequent node insertion.
</p>
<p>If a dummy head node is used, the walk stops
when the index reaches zero. There are no
special cases when using a dummy head node.
</p>
<p>This operation takes <i>&#920;(n)</i> time.
</p>

<h3><a name="id13">remove-from-index</a></h3><p>
Similar to <i>add-at-index</i>, but after
walking to the proper node, the next node is unlinked
from the current node:
</p>
<pre>
    current.next = current.next.next;
</pre>
<p>Usually, the deleted node or the value of the
deleted node is returned after unlinking.
Special cases exist if a dummy head node is
not used or if a tail pointer is used and
the list becomes empty.
</p>
<p>This operation takes <i>&#920;(n)</i> time.
</p>

<h3><a name="id14">is-empty</a></h3><p>
If the size of the list is cached, then this operation
returns whether or not the size is zero. Otherwise, the
list is walked and the whether or not the number of steps 
taken is zero is returned.
</p>

<h3><a name="id15">size</a></h3><p>
If the size of the list is cached, then the size must be updated when add
or remove operations are performed.
</p>

<h3><a name="id16">find</a></h3><p>
Finding a value in the list involves traversing the
list, similar to that of finding a value in an
<a href="index_5.html">array</a>.
</p>

<h2><a name="id17">Traversals</a></h2><p>
Traversing (or walking) a list involves following
<i>next</i> pointers until a null is found:
</p>
<pre>
    current = head;
    while (current != null)
        {
        current = current.next;
        }
</pre>
<p>If a dummy head node is used, the walk is started
using the dummy head node's <i>next</i> pointer.
</p>
<p>Traversing the list takes <i>&#920;(n)</i> time.
</p>
