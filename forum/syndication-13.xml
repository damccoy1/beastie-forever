			<description><![CDATA[Why is the answer Case 1 instead of Case 3? The work at a level is n^2 (log (base 3) of 9) and the work of the recursion is nlogn.<br />
<br />
Nlogn can be simplified to n.<br />
<br />
So the work at a level is n^2 and the work of the recursion is just n. <br />
<br />
The work at a level is doing more work, so shouldn't it be case 3?]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Why is the answer to question number 7 not Case 1?<br />
<br />
The equation is T(n) = 9T(n/4) + (n^2)logn<br />
<br />
This means that the runtime of work at a level is n^(~1.585) which is the log (base 4) of 9.<br />
<br />
If we compare their run times then n^(1.585) &lt; (n^2)log(n)<br />
<br />
This means that since the recursion has a higher growth rate, it contributes more work.<br />
<br />
So why isn't it case 1?]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[I'm having a hard time understanding #9<br />
<br />
In T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n log n, the answer says it falls between cases 2 and 3.<br />
<br />
But isn't the work done at recursion theta(n) and the work done at the level n log n? Why wouldn't it be case 3 since n is a faster run time than n log n?]]></description>
