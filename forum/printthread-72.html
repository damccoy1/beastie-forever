<strong>Debugging Issues</strong> - <a href="http://beastie.cs.ua.edu/forum/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=5">wfairbanks</a> -  <strong>09-18-2018</strong>

The most common error I see after running my program through the provided mass testing tool is "Invalid read of size x". It occurs primarily when running cda operations, and I think it has something to do with my insertion function. I'm confused, because while testing prior to the submission deadline, no test that I created or that I could find would break my insertion function, and it passed the preliminary test pulled from the site as well as the testing dropbox. <br />
<br />
How should I go about trying to find the source of the issue? My index logic is sound, and I can't really see much benefit to debugging step by step, since we're working with pointers.<br />
<br />
How can I test my future projects so that I'm not blindsided like this? Last week, I wrapped up the project, and it worked through all test cases I made or found, but when testing with the provided tool, many of the tests fail inexplicably.

In the future, you could take the test suite from assignment 0, submission 0, and modify them for your particular implementation. That would give you the ability to randomize your testing (in a pseudo random way).<br />
<br />
This is a sad fact of life for a Computer Scientist/Engineer. There is always one more test you SHOULD have run.
