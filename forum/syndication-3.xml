			<description><![CDATA[For number 20 on the exam1.pdf, I'm not sure how to interpret the question. If we delete 5, we have to swap it up to parent until root then extract min (I think). Then we call extract min which gets rid of 5 (which is set to negative infinity) and promotes all the children of 5 up to the root list. At this point do we need answer the question and choose the subheap root for 6? Or do we finish the extract min (which calls to the fixer function I think) and combine same order heaps in the root list and then answer the question? I get two different answers depending on this.]]></description>

<span style="font-style: italic;" class="mycode_i"><span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">General Questions about Masters Recurrence Theorem: </span></span><br />
<br />
Considering this form : T(n) = aT( n b ) + f(n) .<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Are all these valid f(n) ? Means can we apply masters recurrence theorem on it? <br />
         f(n) :   n^n,  2^n,  n!, log n , n/logn , n^3/logn<br />
<br />
2. Is the equation : <span style="font-style: italic;" class="mycode_i">T(n) = 2T(n − 2) + n</span>  valid?  I think not because b !&gt; 1<br />
<br />
 3. Could you explain or could you give an example of an  equation  that would fall between two cases?  <br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-style: italic;" class="mycode_i"><span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">Specific Questions :</span></span> <br />
<br />
#47 : In terms of the master recurrence theorem, where does the equation T(n) = 2T( n / 4 ) + n 0.51 fall?<br />
         <br />
        So, here  n^log b(a)  =&gt;  n^log4(2) =&gt;  n^0.5<br />
<br />
                  and f(n) = n^0.51 <br />
  <br />
        I know that   n^0.5 &lt; n^0.51 , but would be the ans here? <br />
    <br />
      what about this case : n^1.57   and   n^2? <br />
<br />
In general, If the difference between <span style="font-style: italic;" class="mycode_i">n^log b(a) and f(n)</span> is just 0.1 or less than 1, do we assume that they both are equal? <br />
