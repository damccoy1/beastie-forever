A tight lower bound cannot be raised. Suppose f = omega(n^2). Then I know the growth rate of f is strictly greater than the growth rate of n^2. Maybe it's log n * n^2. If it was, then a tight lower bound would be f = Omega(log n * n^2). I can do this for whatever the growth rate of f is. Whatever it is, that growth rate is a better bound than n^2.<br />
<br />
As for theta, the fact that it is also an upper bound does not mean it is not a lower bound. If I give you f = theta(n^2) and I ask what is a tight lower bound for f, you should answer "n^2". You should not answer "I can't tell you because n^2 is also a tight upper bound". <br />
<br />
Theta is both a tight lower bound and a tight upper bound.<br />
<br />
Omega *may* be a tight lower bound or it may not be. It is a tight lower bound in this case: mergesort = Omega(n log n). It is not in this case: mergesort = Omega(1). Both statements are true, but only the first is a tight bount.<br />
<br />
omega can never be a tight bound. It might be the best *known* bound, however.<br />
<br />
Similar of Omicron and omicron.

A student pointed out after class that a complete tree subsumes perfect trees, so the answer "complete" is also a correct answer for question #23.<br />
<br />
I agree with this assessment, so I will give credit for either answer.

For question number 19. Why is the space complexity n and not log n? I thought the loops were supposed to use constant space and therefore the space required would be the same as the previous question. What part am I missing?

I think the part that you are missing is the update to "i" on the recursive call. A constant is being added, not multiplied, so there are a linear number of recursive calls. If the constant had been multiplied, then there would have been a logarithmic number of recursive calls.

That was what I missed. Thanks!
