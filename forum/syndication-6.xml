			<description><![CDATA[So I am trying to wrap my head around the DA union function, and how to both transfer from the donor in amortized O(n) time without doing this:<br />
      insertDA(recipient, recipient-&gt;size, removeDA(donor, donor-&gt;size - 1));<br />
Which flips the order of the donor array.<br />
If I do this: <br />
      insertDA(recipient, recipient-&gt;size, removeDA(donor, 0);<br />
or this:<br />
for (i = 0; i &lt; donor-&gt;size; i++)<br />
      insertDA(recipient, recipient-&gt;size, removeDA(donor, i));<br />
<br />
it runs at O(n^2) time, since both would shift the entire donor array by n every removeDA, and it would take n iterations to empty the donor.<br />
<br />
If there is a third strategy I am missing, or if I am misunderstanding one of the examples I have given, I would love to know it.]]></description>

</li>
</ul>

<br />
My issue, I've found, is when the user tries to get the value at index 0 in an empty array. It passes the first assertion (that index &gt;= 0) but fails the second assertion (that index &lt; sizeDA(items)). Changing the assertion to "the index shall be greater than or equal to zero and less than <span style="font-style: italic;" class="mycode_i">or equal to</span> the size would fix my issue, but would fail to meet project specifications. Is there something I'm missing here or is the spec not correct?<br />

			<description><![CDATA[Hey everyone! I just discovered a bug that's been causing my CDA to seg fault. <br />
<br />
When growing your CDA, make sure to update items-&gt;capacity <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b"><span style="font-style: italic;" class="mycode_i">after </span></span>growing the array and copying all your items over. If you update capacity before growing, then getCDA() will use the new capacity when generating indices and try to access indices in your original array that don't exist... which is bad. If you're experiencing segmentation faults or assertion errors when trying to display or insert after doubling, this might be your issue!<br />
<br />
**Disclaimer: This works when using a temp array and copying items over to double. Not sure how this would affect doubling using realloc().<br />
<br />
Thanks!]]></description>

How should I go about trying to find the source of the issue? My index logic is sound, and I can't really see much benefit to debugging step by step, since we're working with pointers.<br />

			<description><![CDATA[So I'm trying to find out where memory leaks are located in my cda.c file. I modified test cda of test0 so that the only the very first insert into the empty array is occurring. It isn't even printing anything. And in trying to find where it could have happened I nulled out my entire insertCDA, so that it just returns. Even still: I end up with this report:<br />
<br />
<div class="codeblock"><div class="title">Code:</div><div class="body" dir="ltr"><code>==34== 4 bytes in 1 blocks are definitely lost in loss record 1 of 1<br />

==34==    by 0x4009AC: main (testCDA.c:53)</code></div></div><br />
The setup for my newCDA is the same as my newDA, which runs with no leaks, so I don't think that's the issue. And with literally nothing in my insertCDA, is there really some kind of issue with integer.c?]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[So I have been reading through the various posts about the display functions for stack but I am still a bit confused. I think an example would really help me see what is supposed to be happening so here is my question. <br />
<br />
Say I have a newly created stack. If I call displayStack it should print out ||. If I then set the display flag in the Stack struct to 1 via debugStack and then call displayStack it should print []. If I then set the display flag in the Stack struct to 2 via debugStack and then call displayStack it should print [[1]]. Is this the right way to think of it?<br />
<br />
My other question has to do with the order displayStack prints values compared to the order displayDA prints values.<br />
If I pushed 3,2,1 to my Stack in that order would displayStack with a displayFlag set to zero print |1,2,3| and a displayStack with a display Flag set to one print [3,2,1]? <br />
<br />
Thanks for any help!]]></description>

<br />
My other question has to do with the order displayStack prints values compared to the order displayDA prints values.<br />
If I pushed 3,2,1 to my Stack in that order would displayStack with a displayFlag set to zero print |1,2,3| and a displayStack with a display Flag set to one print [3,2,1]? <br />
<br />
Thanks for any help!]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[Sorry, if this was addressed in a previous post, but I couldn't find anything directly addressing my issue.<br />
<br />
I'm going through the code for testing cda.c line by line, and I'm having trouble understanding what to do when shifting the indexes. Currently, I've edited the code to stop just before inserting the value at 3+i. Here is what my array looks like at this point:<br />
<br />
|3|2| |4|<br />
    ^   ^<br />
    b    f<br />
<br />
at i=0, the index to insert 1 is at 3, where the front of my array is. This is confusing me, as this would constitute inserting to the front of the array, result in the array print out as (1,4,3,2) instead of the intended (4,3,2,1).<br />
<br />
The spec says that the previous value at the insertion spot is to be moved to the next higher spot, but higher in what way? If higher means pushing the previous value up one, inserting 4 when the array was just |3|2| would give me:<br />
<br />
|4|2| |3|     then  |4|2|3|1|<br />
<br />
 ^ ^                    ^ ^ <br />
  f  b                     f  b<br />
<br />
which definitely isn't right. If higher means pushing the previous value down one, then the result would be<br />
<br />
|4|3|2| |<br />
 ^    ^<br />
  f    b<br />
<br />
which sets up the next insert all well and good, but looking ahead at the next level of inserts, constantly shifting to the right defeats purpose of the CDA and results in the wrong display as well.<br />
<br />
tldr; In what regard is the "higher" in which you are shifting the index?]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[I have some helper functions that are declared in cda.h and da.h and defined in cda.c and da.c.  They are used by stack.c and queue.c and work perfectly on my system, but when I send it into the test server, I get an implicit declaration error.  Does anyone have any idea why that would be occurring even though they are declared and defined?]]></description>
