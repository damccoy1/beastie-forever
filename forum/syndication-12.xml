			<description><![CDATA[For test attempt one, number 3 asks which statements are always true: <br />
All algorithms are w(1)<br />
All algorithms are O(n^n)<br />
<br />
The answer says neither.<br />
I understand why the first one would be false, but I thought n^n was the worst possible run time, so wouldn't all algorithms be better than or equal to O(n^n)?]]></description>
