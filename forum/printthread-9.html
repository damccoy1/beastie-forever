<strong>One more clarification about using random</strong> - <a href="http://beastie.cs.ua.edu/forum/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=79">jvteel</a> -  <strong>10-08-2018</strong>

I know this has been addressed somewhere else on the forum previously, but I am still confused as to when to use random when creating/building a maze. Different options:<br />
<br />
1) We use just one value to seed the random number generator for the whole maze, and we then only use the random number generator once for the whole maze. (I don't think this is intended at all.)<br />
<br />
2) Any time we need to pick a new eligible neighbor, we generate a new random number using the same seed value from the beginning, and this seed value never changes throughout the creation of the maze. It can be given via the -r option or default to 1. The seed value is never generated by a random number generator with another seed value (i.e. we never use a random number generator to seed another random number generator). The randomness of this approach stems from what the value of count is. <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">Once we find the direction we need to take, we follow this direction until we hit an ineligible neighbor, and then we retrace. </span>(I think this is wrong because it would just create a spiral of a maze, and not a random maze.)<br />
<br />
3) The same logic as (2), but instead of following the same direction until we hit an ineligible neighbor, every time we have to choose a new eligible neighbor, we generate a new random number that decides. <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">(I think this is what is intended.)</span><br />
<br />
I think that (2) is what Dr. Lusth intends, but I want to be 100% certain. If anyone could confirm? Thanks!

I'm pretty sure that number 3 is the intended method. Before building, you seed the generator (using the given value or 1). The seed never changes during the building process. Anytime you are going through the process of adding unvisited neighbors to the stack, let random() choose which unvisited neighbor is added to the stack.
