<h1><a name="id2">Introduction</a></h1><p>
Outlining, like flowcharts for programming, is becoming a lost art.
Unlike flowcharts, however, outlining has not been replaced by
superior approaches. Through proper outlining, a document essentially
writes itself, resulting in a concise, logical, and compelling
narrative.
</p>
<p>The method described herein was invented independently by me, but
I have found subsequently that bits and pieces of my approach have
been suggested before.  My take was that writing a paper ought
to be much like writing a program using <i>stepwise refinement</i><sup><a href="outlining_1.html#footnote-1">1</a></sup>.
With stepwise refinement, one starts out by defining a <i>main</i>
function; the <i>main</i> simply calls a series of subfunctions which do not yet
exist. The <i>step</i> in stepwise refinement is to
define these
subfunctions, which, in turn, may call other functions that
may or may not yet exist. The process ends when all functions
are defined.
</p>
<p>The <i>main</i> function of a program looks much like the outline of
a paper, with the sections of the paper corresponding to the
subfunctions the <i>main</i> function calls. Thus, it should be possible
to apply the technique of stepwise refinement to writing a paper,
should one start with an outline.
When stepwise refinement is applied to an outline,
each section heading of the outline is expanded
to a short description.
The description is then expanded to a series of
paragraph topics. The topics are, in turn,
expanded to partial paragraphs. Finally,
the partial paragraphs
are expanded to complete paragraphs.
I call the combination of outlining and stepwise refinement,
<i>super outlining</i>. Because of the individual
steps taken during the process, super outlining leads to
coherent documents that flow well.
</p>

<h1><a name="id3">Phase I</a></h1><p>
The initial phase of the super-outlining method is to map out the
overall structure of the document, down to the subsection level.
For a research paper documenting an experiment,
the initial outline might look like this:
</p>
<ul><li>Introduction
</li><li>Background
</li><li>Experimental Procedures
</li><li>Results and Analysis
</li><li>Conclusions
</li></ul>
<p>Of course, the section names will vary from discipline to discipline and
whether the paper is experimental, theoretical, or descriptive.
For example, a paper performing a literature review, which is essentially a
<i>Background</i> section expanded into a full paper, might have the following
top-level sections:
</p>
<ul><li>Introduction
</li><li>Early work
</li><li>Seminal discoveries
</li><li>Refinements
</li><li>Remaining Challenges
</li></ul>
<p>Many times, a section is involved enough that subsections are warranted. For
example, an <i>Experimental Procedures</i> section might be further divided:
</p>
<ul><li>Experimental Procedures
<ul><li>Design
</li><li>Fabrication
</li><li>Test
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>Typically, a traditional outline, as shown in the examples above,
is as far as most people get in the outlining
process.
Unfortunately,
while this level of outlining guides the overall structure of
the document, it
gives no insight on how the individual sections and subsections
might be written. So to address this problem,
each section/subsection heading is annotated
with a three-sentence description.
The prose of these paragraphs will not generally appear
in the final document, so it can be casual or instruction-based.
For example, the paragraph describing the <i>Introduction</i>
might look like:
</p>
<ul><li>Introduction
<p><i>
I'll start by stating that inheritance becomes much more
complex within the context of non-local references, supplying
references from Touretzky, Ungar/Smith, and some other
references concerning the D programming language.
I'm going to use the examples of Meyer and Taivalsaari to
motivate the need for solving the problem.
Then I'm going to give a hint about a possible inheritance
approach using scope, rather than self-reference, in an attempt
to simply and clarify the semantics of inheritance.
</i>
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>The example here uses ideas from Computer Science, but don't
let that get in the way of this guiding principle that applies to
all documents: each section is
annotated with a three-sentence paragraph describing the ideas that
will be expressed within the section.
</p>
<p>A big draw of super-outlining depends on the theory that spending more
time up front organizing your thoughts
will reduce the overall time writing
the full paper.
By writing the section descriptions,
it then becomes
a simple matter to expand the outline further in Phase II.
</p>

<h1><a name="id4">Phase II</a></h1><p>
In Phase II, one envisions the paragraphs needed to flesh out the
section descriptions. After each description, one places a list of
one-sentence paragraph topics; if you will need five paragraphs to
succinctly implement the section, then you should place a list
of five sentences following the section description. Deciding on
the number and topics of the paragraphs is usually a back-and-forth
process, with the number of paragraphs growing and shrinking as
you decide on the paragraph topics. Be sure to reserve the
last paragraph in a section as an introduction to the next
section, if appropriate.
</p>
<p>For example, a paragraph topic list for <i>Introduction</i> might look like:
</p>
<ul><li>Introduction
<p><i>
I'll start by stating that inheritance becomes much more
complex within the context of non-local references, supplying
references from Touretzky, Ungar/Smith, and some other
references concerning the D programming language.
I'm going to use the examples of Meyer and Taivalsaari to
motivate the need for solving the problem.
Then I'm going to give a hint about a possible inheritance
approach using scope, rather than self-reference, in an attempt
to simply and clarify the semantics of inheritance.

</p>
<ol><li>What is inheritance and what are the formal approaches to describing
inheritance?
</li><li>How are non-local references in an ancestor class handled under
the formal descriptions?
</li><li>Should non-locals be handled differently and, if so, what are
the advantages and disadvantages of doing so?
</li><li>Posit the theory that manipulating scope is simpler than self-reference
and handles non-local references correctly.
</li><li>Describe the rest of the paper, indicating the existence and purpose
of each of the following sections.
</li></ol>
</li></ul>
<p>Although you may not know much about CS inheritance, you can see from
the example the beginnings of flow. Notice how the topic sentences 
lead from the description of the problem to its solution.
</p>
<p>During Phase II, it is common to return to Phase I and modify the
section descriptions. In fact, it would be rather unusual <i>not</i>
to do so.
</p>

<h1><a name="id5">Phase III</a></h1><p>
In Phase III, each paragraph topic is augmented with the introductory
and closing sentences of the paragraph. This will further cement
the 
'flow'
of the document;
care should be taken that the closing sentence of a paragraph should
serve as a transition to the next paragraph, if appropriate. Indeed,
after adding these bracketing sentences,
one should be able to read the entire document as a
coherent whole.
</p>
<p>As an example, a Phase III
'paragraph'
might look like this:
</p>
<div class="quote">
If an object truly inherits the <i>functionality</i> of its ancestor,
then non-local references in ancestor methods should reflect
the point of view of the actual object, not the view of an ancestor object
which does not even exist.
...<i>Should non-locals be handled differently and, if so, what are
the advantages and disadvantages of doing so?</i>...
The traditional handling of non-locals likely stems from an
ease-of-implementation issue; is there an equally simple implementation
that handles non-locals properly?
</div>

<h1><a name="id6">Writing the paper</a></h1><p>
At this point, the full paper can be attempted. While
filling out the middles of the partial paragraphs of Phase III,
one should
move each paragraph description to precede the paragraph
it describes.
One should also set off
the section descriptions and the moved paragraph descriptions in a different
font.
For the final edit, the section and paragraph descriptions are not
deleted, but set off as non-printing notes within the document.
</p>

<h1><a name="id7">Other considerations</a></h1><p>
Any document that is intended to be widely read should tell a story.
That is to say, an <i>Abstract</i>, if required,
should give a synopsis of the entire story,
while the <i>Introduction</i> should set up, in a compelling way, 
the problem that needs to be solved. Concrete examples of how the
problem manifests itself should also be included in the <i>Introduction</i>.
The <i>Background</i>, could give a chronological history of how
the problem arose, if appropriate.
The middle sections describe the meat-and-potatos version of the
problem solution.
Finally, the <i>Conclusions</i> section should recap the problem,
its solution, and the strength and weaknesses of the solution.
</p>
<p>Another rule the successful writer should use, if possible,
is the <i>Rule of Three</i>. The <i>Rule of Three</i> states that 
any complex idea, thought, or approach, should be broken down
into three components. If any of the components is still too
complex to be described succinctly, it too should be broken
down into three subcomponents, and so. Resist the attempt to use
four or more subcomponents and <i>never</i> use two.
The <i>Rule of Three</i>
also states that the most important aspects of the document,
typically the problem and its solution, should be repeated 
three times within the document. Given that the <i>Abstract</i> and
the <i>Conclusions</i> both summarize the work described in
the document, the desired repetition of the key points should
happen naturally.
</p>
<p>Lastly, in the final editing of the document, a critical eye
is placed on each paragraph, each sentence and on each word of the document.
Each item should only be present if it contributes in an original way
to the overall story told by the document; otherwise, it should
be removed. Typically, via super-outlining, each paragraph is serving
a purpose, but often sentences repeat information or are awkward
and inelegant.
Questions to ask are:
</p>
<ul><li>Does this sentence repeat information that has already been
stated?
</li><li>If not, is the sentence absolutely necessary for purpose of the
paragraph?
</li><li>Is each word absolutely necessary for the purpose of the
sentence? In other words, can the sentence be shortened
but still retain its meaning?
</li></ul>
<p>By looking critically at the word and sentence level, a document
can both be shortened and become more elegantly written.
