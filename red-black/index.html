Here are some terms that are used when discussing <i>red</i>-<i>black</i> trees:
<br/>

<ul>

<li>

 <b>child</b> &mdash; same as for binary search trees
</li>

<li>

 <b>parent</b> &mdash; same as for binary search trees
</li>

<li>

 <b>leaf</b> &mdash; same as for binary binary search trees
</li>

<li>

 <b>grandparent</b> &mdash; parent of parent
</li>

<li>

 <b>uncle</b> &mdash; sibling of parent
</li>

<li>

 <b>niece</b> &mdash; closest child of sibling -
if you are a right child, your niece is a right child -
if you are a left child, your niece is a left child
</li>

<li>

 <b>nephew</b> &mdash; furthest child of sibling - if you are a right child,
your nephew is a left child -
if you are a left child, your nephew is a right child
</li>

<li>

 <b>black height</b> &mdash; the number of black nodes encountered on the way
to a leaf - sometimes abbreviated <i>BH</i>
</li>

<li>

 <b>linear</b> &mdash; true if the parent and child are both left children or
are both right children
</li>

<li>

 <b>rotation</b> &mdash; make a child a parent and the former parent a child
- preserves binary search tree ordering
</li>

</ul>


Note that terms like
<i>uncle</i>, <i>niece</i>, and <i>nephew</i>
are not found in other binary search tree
descriptions.
They are used here in order to remove
leftness and rightness issues from the main
red-black tree algorithms.

<h2> Red-black properties
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

A <i>red</i>-<i>black</i> tree has the following properties:
<br/>

<ul>

<li>

 The root is colored black
</li>

<li>

 The null child pointers of a leaf are considered black nodes
</li>

<li>

 No red node has a red parent
</li>

<li>

 All nodes have a consistent black height
(all paths from a node to the reachable leaves have the same number of black nodes)
</li>

</ul>
