<h1>Variables</h1>
<p>Suppose you found an envelope lying on the street and on the front of
the envelope was printed the name <i>numberOfDogsTeeth</i>.
Suppose further
that you opened the envelope and inside was a piece of paper with
the number 42 written upon it.
What might you conclude from such an
encounter? Now suppose you kept walking and found another envelope
labeled <i>meaningOfLifeUniverseEverything</i> and,
again, upon opening it
you found a slip of paper with the number 42 on it.
Further down the
road,
you find two more envelopes,
entitled <i>numberOfDotsOnPairOfDice</i> and
<i>StatueOfLibertyArmLength</i>,
both of which contain the number 42.
</p>
<p>Finally,
you find one last envelope labeled <i>sixTimesNine</i> and inside of it
you,
yet again,
find the number 42.
At this point,
you're probably thinking "somebody
has an odd affection for the number 42" but then the times table that
is stuck somewhere in the dim recesses of your brain begins yelling at
you saying "54! It's 54!".
After this goes on for an embarrassingly long
time,
you realize that 6 * 9 is not 42, but 54.
So you cross out the 42
in the last envelope and write 54 instead and put the envelope back
where you found it.
</p>
<p>This strange little story,
believe it or not,
has profound implications
for writing programs that both humans and computers can understand.
For
programming languages,
the envelope is a metaphor for something called
a <i>variable</i>,
which can be thought of as a label for a place in memory
where a literal value can reside.
In other words, a variable can be thought of as a convenient
name for a value.
In many programming languages,
one can change the value at that memory location,
much like replacing
the contents of an envelope<sup><a href="index_26.html#footnote-5">5</a></sup>.
A variable is our first encounter with a
concept known as <i>abstraction</i>,
a concept that is fundamental to the whole
of Computer Science<sup><a href="index_26.html#footnote-6">6</a></sup>.
</p>

<h2><a name="id1">Variables</a></h2><p>
Most likely,
you've encountered the term <i>variable</i> before.
Consider the
<i>slope-intercept</i> form of an algebraic equation of a particular line:
</p>
<blockquote><i>  y = 2x - 3 </i></blockquote>
<p>You probably can tell from this equation that the slope of this line
is 2 and that it intercepts the <i>y</i>-axis at -3.
But what role do
the letters <i>y</i> and <i>x</i> actually play?  The names <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>
are placeholders that stand for the <i>x</i>- and <i>y</i>-coordinates of any
conceivable point on that line.
Without placeholders,
the line would
have to be described by listing every point on the line.
Since there
are an infinite number of points,
clearly an exhaustive list is not
feasible.
As you learned in your algebra class,
the common name for a
place holder for a specific value is the term <i>variable</i>.
</p>
<p>One can generalize<sup><a href="index_26.html#footnote-7">7</a></sup>
the above line resulting in an equation that describes
every line.
</p>
<blockquote><i>  y = mx + b </i></blockquote>
<p>Here,
the variable <i>m</i> stands for the slope and <i>b</i> stands for the
<i>y</i>-intercept.
Clearly,
this equation was not dreamed up by an English-speaking Computer
Scientist; a cardinal rule is to choose good names or
mnemonics for variables,
such as <i>s</i> for slope and <i>i</i> for intercept.
But alas,
for historical reasons,
we are stuck with <i>m</i> and <i>b</i>.
</p>
<p>The term <i>variable</i> is also used in most programming languages,
including
C,
and the term has roughly the equivalent meaning.
The difference is
programming languages use the envelope metaphor
while algebraic meaning of variable is an equivalence to a value<sup><a href="index_26.html#footnote-8">8</a></sup>.
The difference is purely philosophical and not worth going into at this
time.
</p>

<h2><a name="id2">Creating, combining, and printing variables</a></h2><p>
Suppose you found three envelopes,
marked <i>m</i>, <i>x</i>, and <i>b</i>,
and inside
those three envelopes you found the numbers 6, 9, and -12 respectively.
If
you were asked to make a <i>y</i> envelope,
what number should you put inside?
If
the number 42 in the <i>sixTimesNine</i> envelope in the previous story did not
bother you (e.g., your internal times table was nowhere to be found),
perhaps you might need a little help in completing your task.
We can
have C calculate this number with the following dialog:
</p>
<pre>
    //test - copy this code and paste it at the quickc prompt
    int m = 6;
    int x = 9;
    int b = -12;
    int y = m * x + b;
    printf("y is %d\n",y);           //should print: y is 42
</pre>
<p>One creates variables in C by 
first giving the type of the value the variable is to hold.
In this case, we are creating variables that hold integers;
the keyword <code>int</code> tells us that.
Next comes the name of the variable. If one wishes to
immediately give the variable a value (which we do), we
follow the variable name with an equals sign and the value
we wish the variable to have.
Note that this value can be a literal or some combination of
literals and variables. In any case, the type of the expression
(generally) should match the type of the variable.
</p>
<p>The code that creates a variable is known as a 
<i>variable definition</i>. When a variable is defined,
the compiler allocates some space in memory to hold
the value of the variable. Sometimes, we wish to inform the compiler
that a variable will be defined elsewhere. For that task, we
use a <i>variable declaration</i>. To declare
that a variable exists somewhere else, we use the <code>extern</code>
keyword. For example, to say that the variable <i>x</i>, defined above
exists, we would say:
</p>
<pre>
    extern int x;      //variable declaration: x exists!
</pre>
<p>This tells the compiler the subsequent occurrences of <i>x</i>
in the code
refer to an integer and that space for <i>x</i> has already been
allocated.
Many people, even long-time C programmers, confuse the terms <i>definition</i>
and <i>declaration</i>. The reason is C does not treat
declarations and definitions consistently. For example,
in some contexts, C can treat:
</p>
<pre>
    int x;
</pre>
<p>as a declaration, but in others, C treats it as a definition<sup><a href="index_26.html#footnote-9">9</a></sup>.
Just remember, if you see a type and
a variable name, it's (likely) a
definition. If you see the word <code>extern</code> in front, it's a declaration.
</p>
<p>Continuing on with the example above, we combine the
values of <i>m</i>, <i>x</i>, and <i>b</i> using multiplication<sup><a href="index_26.html#footnote-10">10</a></sup>
and addition to determine the value of variable
<i>y</i>.
C,
when asked to compute the value of an expression containing variables, as in:
</p>
<pre>
    m * x + b
</pre>
<p>goes to those envelopes and
retrieves the values stored there and combines them as directed.
The last line of code:
</p>
<pre>
    printf("y is %d\n",y);
</pre>
<p>shows of some of the sophistication of the <i>printf</i> function.
As we discussed when we introduced the <i>main</i> function,
functions can take in raw data. In this case, the <i>printf</i>
function is being passed two pieces of information,
a string and a variable, separated by a comma.
The string guides <i>printf</i> on how to do the printing. Inside the string
is the character sequence:
</p>
<pre>
    %d
</pre>
<p>This informs <i>printf</i> to look for an additional value beyond the
string and substitute that value for the <code>%d</code>. Moreover, the
<code>d</code> in the <code>%d</code> indicates that <i>printf</i> 
should print that value as an integer. Moreover, when we give a
variable to a function to be used as data, we actually send the
value of the variable. In our code, the value of <i>y</i> will be 42, so we
should see:
</p>
<pre>
    y is 42
</pre>
<p>displayed when we run the program. The <code>%d</code> is known as a
<i>format</i> <i>directive</i>.
Inserting our test code into the template program <i>tester.c</i> gives us the
following source code:
</p>
<pre>
    //template for testing code
    //download with: wget troll.cs.ua.edu/ACP-C/tester.c
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
    #include &lt;string.h&gt;
    #include &lt;math.h&gt;

    int main(int argc,char **argv)
        {
        //test code goes here
        int m = 6;
        int x = 9 ;
        int b = -12;
        int y = m * x + b;

        printf("y is %d\n",y);

        return 0;
        }
</pre>
<p>Compiling:
</p>
<pre>
    lusth@warka:~/cs100$ gcc -Wall -g tester.c -o tester
</pre>
<p>and running this program produces the output:
</p>
<pre>
    lusth@warka:~/cs100$ tester
    y is 42
</pre>
<p>just as expected. Pasting the test code at the <i>quickc</i> prompt gives
us the same result.
</p>
<p>Here are some more examples of variable creation:
</p>
<pre>
    //test
    int dots = 42;
    int bones = 206;
    printf("%d\n",dots);            //should print: 42
    printf("%d\n",bones);           //should print: 206
    int CLXIV = bones - dots;
    printf("%d\n",CLXIV);           //should print: 164
</pre>
<p>After a variable is created,
the variable or its value can be used interchangeably.
For example,
it is an easy matter to
set up an equivalence between the variable <b>PI</b> and the real number 3.14159.
</p>
<pre>
    //test
    double PI = 3.14159;
    double radius = 10.0;
    double area = PI * radius * radius;
    double circumference = 2 * PI * radius;
    printf("area is %f, while circumference is %f\n",area,circumference);
</pre>
<p>Compiling and running this code inside the template program should yield the output:
</p>
<pre>
    area is 314.159000, while circumference is 62.831800
</pre>
<p>Recall that the <code>double</code> type is used for variables that hold real numbers.
Notice how the expressions used to compute the values of the variables
area and circumference are more readable than if 3.14159 was used
instead of <b>PI</b>.
In fact,
that is one of the main uses of variables,
to
make code more readable.
The second is if the value of <b>PI</b> should change
(e.g., if a more accurate value of <b>PI</b> is desired<sup><a href="index_26.html#footnote-11">11</a></sup>),
we would only need
to change the definition of <b>PI</b>.
From the example above, we can see that to print a real number,
we need to use the <code>%f</code> format directive in the guide string for <i>printf</i>.
</p>

<h2><a name="id3">Variables and memory</a></h2><p>
A variable in C refers to a memory location. At that memory location,
the value of the variable is stored. One can imagine memory as a series of
boxes. Using <i>m</i> as an example, the variable <i>m</i> identifies one of
those boxes and the value of <i>m</i> is placed inside
that box:
</p>
<div align="center">
<img scale=0.50 alt="" src="pic-variable1.png"/>
</div>
<p>Just like a house on a street (the street being memory and 
the house being the box), every box in memory has an address.
Having variables makes the actual address irrelevant, but let's
just say the variable <i>m</i>
refers to the box at address 1976 in memory<sup><a href="index_26.html#footnote-12">12</a></sup>.
If actual addresses are important, we will place them above the box:
</p>
<div align="center">
<img scale=0.50 alt="" src="pic-variable2.png"/>
</div>
<p>Since the actual address of a memory location rarely matters,
we will most often use a simpler notation for variables and their values:
</p>
<div align="center">
<p><table><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" align="right">
<i>m</i>: </td><td colspan="1" align="left"> 6</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="1" align="right">
</td></tr></tbody></table>
</p>
</div>
<p>This notation should be read as 
"<i>m</i> identifies a location in memory that holds the value 6".
Often, we will shorten this to "<i>m</i> is 6".
</p>

<h2><a name="id4">Variable naming</a></h2><p>
Like many languages,
C is quite restrictive in regards to legal variable names.
A variable name must begin with a letter or an underscore
and may be followed by any number of letters, digits, or
underscores.
</p>
<p>Variables are the next layer in a programming languages,
resting on
the literal expressions and combinations of expressions (which are
expressions themselves).
In fact,
variables can be thought of as an
abstraction of the literals and collections of literals.
As an analogy,
consider your name.
Your
name is not you,
but it is a convenient (and abstract) way of referring
to you.
In the same way,
variables can be considered as the names of
things.
A variable isn't the thing itself,
but a convenient way to referring
to the thing.
</p>
<p>While C lets you name variables in wild ways:
</p>
<pre>
    int _1_2_3_iiiiii__ = 7;
</pre>
<p>you should temper your
creativity if it gets out of hand.
For example,
rather than use the
variable <i>m</i> for the slope,
we could use the name <i>slope</i> instead:
</p>
<pre>
    int slope = 6;
</pre>
<p>We could have also used a different name:
</p>
<pre>
    int _e_p_o_l_s_ = 6;
</pre>
<p>The name <i>&#95;e&#95;p&#95;o&#95;l&#95;s&#95;</i>
is a perfectly good variable name from C's point of
view.
It is a particularly poor name from the point of making your C
programs readable by you and others.
It is important that your variable
names reflect their purpose.
In the example above,
which is the better name: <i>b</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>intercept</i>, or 
<i>&#95;t&#95;p&#95;e&#95;c&#95;r&#95;e&#95;t&#95;n&#95;i&#95;</i>
to represent the intercept of a line?
</p>

<h2><a name="id5">Uninitialized variables</a></h2><p>
If you create an integer variable, but don't initialize it:
</p>
<pre>
    int x;
</pre>
<p>the value held by that variable is some random integer<sup><a href="index_26.html#footnote-13">13</a></sup>.
Thus, if your
program uses the value of an uninitialized variable, not only is it likely to
compute incorrect results, it will also likely compute different results each
time it is run.
The same is true of all other types of variables as well.
</p>
<p>An uninitialized variable is said to be <i>filled with garbage</i>, which leads to
the old saying about computer programs:
</p>
<div class="quote">
<i>garbage in, garbage out</i>
