<h1>The C Framework</h1>
<p>Working with C requires that you be able to edit a text file.
I use <i>vim</i> as my text editor. <i>Vim</i> is
an editor that was written by programmers
for programmers (<i>emacs</i> is another such
editor) and Serious Computer Scientists
and Programmers should learn either <i>vim</i> or <i>emacs</i>.
</p>
<p>C also requires that your program follow certain guidelines, such as
your source code 
having a function called <i>main</i>. You may not know what a function
is, so we are going to give you an entire program for you to enter 
into a file named <i>hello.c</i>. By convention, all C programs and
modules (we will learn about modules later) should be stored as
text files with the filenames ending in <i>.c</i>.  Please note that case
is important - you must enter a lowercase <i>.c</i>.
</p>

<h2><a name="id1">Your first program</a></h2><p>
Using vim (or emacs), place the following code in a file named <i>hello.c</i>:
</p>
<pre>
    int
    main()
        {
        printf("hello, world!");
        return 0;
        }
</pre>
<p>Save your work and exit the text editor.
</p>
<p>Now issue the following command at the
system prompt to <i>compile</i> the file:
</p>
<pre>
    gcc hello.c
</pre>
<p>Compiling
and linking (more on linking when we get to modules) is
the process of turning source code (what you placed in
the file <i>hello.c</i>) into executable code (code that
your computer can understand and run).
If you do a directory listing after running the above command,
you should see a new file created named <i>a.out</i>.
This new file contains the executable code. To run the
code, one types the command:
</p>
<pre>
    ./a.out
</pre>
<p>You should see the phrase:
</p>
<pre>
    hello, world!
</pre>
<p>displayed on your console. Note that if you are using Cygwin, the executable
will be named <i>a.exe</i>, instead of <i>a.out</i>. Here's a trace of both commands:
</p>
<pre>
    lusth@warka:~$ gcc hello.c
    lusth@warka:~$ ./a.out
    hello, world!
    lusth@warka:~$
</pre>
<p>where <code>lusth@warka:~$</code> is my system prompt;
yours will be different.
</p>

<h2><a name="id2">More advanced compilation</a></h2><p>
Most advanced programmers do not compile this simple way. The command you should
use from now on should look something like this:
</p>
<pre>
    gcc -Wall -g hello.c -o hello -lm
</pre>
<p>The term <code>-Wall</code> tells the compiler to issue all warnings. 
This will tell you if you have some
stylistic or other non-critical errors in your code.
In the Linux world, terms beginning with a dash are denoted <i>options</i>.
The <code>-g</code> option tells the compiler to save information
in the executable code that will allow you to debug the code should you need to.
The <code>-o</code> option says
to forgo <i>a.out</i> as the name of the executable file; rather the name following the <code>-o</code>
should be used instead.
In the example above,
the name of the executable file is designated to be <i>hello</i> (no extension).
By convention, the name of the executable file is the base name of the <i>.c</i>
file that contains
the <i>main</i> function.
Finally, the <code>-lm</code> at the end of the <i>gcc</i> command
adds in some important math functions.
</p>
<p>If you ran the <i>gcc</i> command with the <code>-Wall</code> option,
you would see a couple of
warning messages generated:
</p>
<pre>
    lusth@warka:~$ gcc -Wall -g hello.c -o hello
    hello.c: In function 'main':
    hello.c:4:5: warning: implicit declaration of function 'printf'
    hello.c:4:5: warning: incompatible implicit declaration of built-in function 'printf'
</pre>
<p>You will receive many such warnings in your C programming career.
The warning states that we are calling a built-in function named <code>printf</code>,
yet we haven't told the compiler how
one calls the <i>printf</i> function<sup><a href="index_26.html#footnote-1">1</a></sup>.
We fix this problem by telling the compiler
to look for the missing information in what is known as a <i>standard</i>
<i>header</i> file. Header files, by conventions, end in <i>.h</i>.
We use the <i>include</i> directive to indicate the name of the header file.
Our program now
becomes:
</p>
<pre>
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    
    int
    main()
        {
        printf("hello, world!");
        return 0;
        }
</pre>
<p>With this addition, our program compiles without any warnings issued.
</p>
<p>From now on, always use the <code>-Wall</code>,
<code>-g</code>, and <code>-o</code> options when compiling unless you have good reason
not to.
</p>

<h2><a name="id3">Breaking down <i>hello.c</i></a></h2><p>
Let's look in more detail at the <i>hello.c</i> program. We have annotated it
to show the line numbers:
</p>
<pre>
    1:    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    2:    
    3:    int
    4:    main()
    5:        {
    6:        printf("hello, world!");
    7:        return 0;
    8:        }
</pre>
<p>As stated previously, line 1 is an include directive, which informs the
compiler what a call to the <i>printf</i> function (among many functions)
should look like. We can tell we are including a standard header file
by the use of the angle brackets
(the <i>less than</i> and <i>greater than</i> symbols).
A standard header file is installed for you automatically and you generally
don't need to know where it is located<sup><a href="index_26.html#footnote-2">2</a></sup>.
Later, we will learn how to define and include local header files.
</p>
<p>Line 3 holds the <i>return type</i> of the <i>main</i> function. You can think of
a function as a little factory. It takes in raw data and produces refined
data or <i>information</i>.
The data, whether raw or refined, is made up of the primitive values or
collections thereof.
These values all have types, which you will learn about in the next chapter.
One of the primitive types is <code>int</code>,
which stands for an integer. So line 3
is saying that the <i>main</i> function will produce an integer as a result of
the work it does.
</p>
<p>Line 4 holds the name of the function (in this case <i>main</i>)
and a comma-separated, parenthesized list of the
receptacles that will hold the incoming raw data (in this case, there are
no receptacles). If <i>main</i> had required some incoming raw data to do its
job, the names of the receptacles and the types of data the receptacles hold
would be listed between the parentheses. As <i>hello.c</i> is such a simple
program, the <i>main</i> function does not need any incoming data, leading to
the empty set of parentheses.
Together, lines 3 and 4 compose the <i>signature</i> of a function. 
Later on, you will
learn more on functions, function signatures, and formal parameters (the
official name of the receptacles that hold the incoming raw data).
</p>
<p>Line 5 is an <i>open brace</i>, which indicates the beginning of a <i>block</i>.
A block is a section of code which is run sequentially. A line of code
that appears earlier in the block is <i>executed</i><sup><a href="index_26.html#footnote-3">3</a></sup>
after any preceding code in the block and prior to any subsequent code in the
block.
Line 8 holds a <i>close brace</i>,
which indicates the end of a block of code.
</p>
<p>Lines 6 and 7 are the lines of code in the block that is associated
with the <i>main</i> function. We visually show the block belongs to <i>main</i>
by indenting it. Line 6 prints out the message we see when we run the
program. Line 7 gives the refined data value that the <i>main</i> function
produces as a result of all its work. In this case, it says that the
<i>main</i> function returns a zero when it is done. Note that zero is
an integer, which matches the return type found on line 3.
The return value of a function is almost always used in some way, often
serving as the raw data to be given to some other function. In the case
of <i>main</i> functions in C programs, the return value of <i>main</i> indicates
whether or not the program ran successfully. By conventions, a zero
return value from <i>main</i> means 'zero errors'. If an error occurred,
some other integer value would be returned. We will learn how to choose
between returning zero or some other integer when we learn about conditionals.
</p>
<p>All C programs require a <i>main</i> function,
so until you can write a <i>main</i>
function for scratch, use the following version as a starting point:
</p>
<pre>
    //template for testing code
    //download with: wget troll.cs.ua.edu/ACP-C/tester.c
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;     // Provides standard I/O functions
    #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;    // Includes a number of basic built-in functions
    #include &lt;string.h&gt;    // Provides functions that operate on strings
    #include &lt;math.h&gt;      // Provides a wealth of mathematical functions

    int
    main(int argc,char **argv)
        {
        /* place code here */

        return 0;
        }
</pre>
<p>You'll notice this version has a few more include directives plus a
couple of
formal parameters for the <i>main</i> function.
These formal parameters accept any command-line arguments (as stated earlier,
command-line arguments will be covered in a later chapter).
In addition, the very first line is a <i>comment</i>, meaning it is there
to be read, but is otherwise ignored by the C compiler.
Comments that begin with <code>//</code> are called <i>line comments</i>;
the
compiler ignores those characters and
every character beyond on the same line.
The template program exhibits another style of comment, the block comment.
In a block comment, the <code>/*</code> and <code>*/</code> characters and all the characters between,
are ignored by the compiler. The advantage of block comments is
that they can be placed in between source code bits and 
can also span lines.
</p>

<h2><a name="id4">About C programs and whitespace</a></h2><p>
Other than line comments and include directives,
there are no rules for C programs
specifying what parts of the programs have to be on what lines. For example,
the template program above could have been written like this:
</p>
<pre>
    //template for testing code
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
    #include &lt;math.h&gt;
    int main(int argc,char **argv) { /* place code here */ return 0; }
</pre>
<p>Note that the entire <i>main</i> function is on a single line.
This is because C is a <i>free-format</i> language. A free-format language
says wherever you can have <i>whitespace</i> (a space or a tab or a newline),
you can replace it with some other kind of whitespace or any combination of
whitespace characters.
</p>

<h2><a name="id5">Vim and C</a></h2><p>
In order to be most efficient at programming, one needs to configure the
editor to understand the language being edited.
We will do that now.
</p>
<p>Move into your home directory with the:
</p>
<pre>
    cd
</pre>
<p>command and list the files found there
with this version of the <i>ls</i> command:
</p>
<pre>
    ls -al
</pre>
<p>If you see the file <i>.exrc</i>, then all is well and good.
If you do not, then run the following command to
retrieve it:
</p>
<pre>
    (cd ; wget troll.cs.ua.edu/ACP-C/.exrc)
</pre>
<p>This places a copy of the <code>.exrc</code> file in your home directory.  It contains
a number of commands that help customize <tt>vim</tt> for writing C programs, they
configure <tt>vim</tt> to understand C syntax and to color various primitives and
keywords in a pleasing manner. 
These commands are processed every time that you invoke <tt>vim</tt>.
</p>

<h2><a name="id6">Four Shortcuts to Improve Efficiency</a></h2><p>
You can program your entire life without knowing the following four shortcuts.
However, that is the same as typing <tt>http://</tt> on every website that you visit.
You can save time if you know a few basic tricks for the <i>edit-compile-test</i> cycle.
</p>

<h3><a name="id7">Running a Program without leaving the Editor</a></h3><p>
Since you spend a lot of your development time in the edit-compile-test cycle,
being able to compile and test your program without officially leaving the editor
can save significant time.  We can add some macros (shortcuts) to <i>vim</i> so that
compilation and testing of your program can be done while editing.
</p>
<p>First, go to your home directory (<i>cd</i>) and check to see if you have an <i>.exrc</i>
file.  If you retrieved the <tt>.exrc</tt> file from <i>troll.cs.ua.edu</i>
as described in Section 2.5, then this line already exists.
If you do not have a <i>.exrc</i> file in your home directory then either copy it (as
described in Section 2.5) or create
the file yourself and add this line at the top of the file:
</p>
<pre>
    map @    :!clear; rm -f a.out; gcc -Wall -g % -lm; ./a.out^M
</pre>
<p>The <code>^M</code> part of the macro is not a two character sequence
(<code>^</code> followed by <tt>M</tt>),
but a single character made by typing <code>&lt;Ctrl&gt;-v</code> followed by
<code>&lt;Ctrl&gt;-m</code>.
It's just when you type <code>&lt;Ctrl&gt;-v &lt;Ctrl&gt;-m</code>, it will display as
<code>^M</code>.
</p>
<p>What this line says is that, when the <code>@</code> key is pressed, the system should:
</p>
<ol><li>clear the screen,
</li><li>remove the old <i>a.out</i> file,
</li><li>run the <i>gcc</i> compiler on
the file you are currently editing and place the executable
code in the default file named <i>a.out</i>,
</li><li>then run the executable code.
</li></ol>
<p>Remember, to save your work (<tt>:w</tt> is one method) before running this command.
Also, if you are using Cygwin, then
replace the occurrences of <i>a.out</i> with <i>a.exe</i>.
</p>
<p>How does this work?  Suppose you are editing a file named
<i>project1.c</i>, then the <code>@</code> command would be equivalent to you 
first saving your file, exiting the editor, and then running the commands:
</p>
<pre>
    lusth@warka:~$ rm a.out
    lusth@warka:~$ gcc -Wall -g project1.c -lm
    lusth@warka:~$ ./a.out
</pre>
<p>You can see that the <code>@</code> macro saves you quite a bit of typing!
</p>

<h3><a name="id8">Running a Program with Command Line Arguments from within the Editor</a></h3><p>
As you expand your programming knowledge, you will be writing programs that take
<i>command-line arguments</i> when you execute them.  These are simply data
values that are provided when you execute the program.  In these cases, you need
to be able to enter them before hitting <tt>return</tt> on the line that invokes
your program.  So that <code>^M</code> in the <code>@</code> command above needs to be removed, as 
<code>^M</code> represents an <i>enter</i> on the command line.
Thus, we create a new macro <code>#</code> that is the same as the old,
except the <code>^M</code> has been removed.
The <code>#</code> macro pauses to let you enter
command-line arguments to your C program<sup><a href="index_26.html#footnote-4">4</a></sup>.
</p>
<pre>
    map # :!clear; rm a.out; gcc -Wall -g % -lm; ./a.out
</pre>
<p>As you did with the <code>@</code> macro, add the line above to the <i>.exrc</i> file
in your home directory if it does not already exist.
</p>

<h3><a name="id9">Configuring VIM to Display C Programs Elegantly</a></h3><p>
The commands below help <i>vim</i> to display C programs in a pleasing format.
Make sure to add these lines to your <i>.exrc</i> if you had to create one from 
scratch:
</p>
<pre>
    set autoindent
    set shiftwidth=4
    set tabstop=4
    set expandtab
    set softtabstop=4
    set smarttab
    syntax enable 
    autocmd FileType make setlocal noexpandtab
</pre>

<h3><a name="id10">Cut and Paste in VIM using the Mouse</a></h3><p>
You can copy and paste test code with the mouse.
On a Linux system, the copy command is <code>Shift-Control-c</code>,
rather than <code>Control-c</code> used in Windows. This is because
<code>Control-c</code> in Linux means "kill the currently running program".
You will find <code>Control-c</code> quite useful when you write programs
that don't behave like you think they should.
The paste command is <code>Control-v</code>, just like it is in Windows.
</p>
<p>Because you likely have autoindent turned on in Vim, when you
get ready to paste, turn off autoindent with the vim command:
</p>
<pre>
    :set noai
</pre>
<p>Then go into insert mode and do the paste. To turn autoindent back on,
enter this vim command:
</p>
<pre>
    :set ai
</pre>
<p>The <i>.exrc</i> file on <i>troll</i> has a macro that takes care of the
pasting issue:
</p>
<pre>
    map &lt;F9&gt; :set paste!
</pre>
<p>This macro toggles autoindent,
so to paste with the mouse, press <code>&lt;F9&gt;</code> first.
Press <code>&lt;F9&gt;</code> again to turn autoindent back on.
</p>

<h2><a name="id11">One Final Comment</a></h2><p>
In subsequent chapters, code that we wish for you to insert
into the template C program, <i>tester.c</i>, given above
will start with:
</p>
<pre>
    //test
</pre>
<p>This is simply a shorthand notation used in the text.  Mentally,
you should replace <tt>//test</tt> with:
</p>
<pre>
    //template for testing code
    //download with: wget troll.cs.ua.edu/ACP-C/tester.c
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
    #include &lt;string.h&gt;
    #include &lt;math.h&gt;

    int
    main(int argc,char **argv)
        {
</pre>
<p>and follow the test code with:
</p>
<pre>
        return 0;
        }
</pre>
<p>Computer Scientists are all about efficiency; we can make the process of
testing code fragments in this book even easier. We do so by writing
a program (no surprise there)
that does this mental replacement for you; the program is
called <i>quickc</i> and is discussed in the next chapter.
