<h1>More about Functions</h1>
<p>We have already seen some examples of functions,
some user-defined and some built-in.
For example, we have used the built-in functions,
such as 
<tt>printf</tt> and defined our own functions,
such as <i>square</i>.
C has many built-in, or <i>predefined</i>, functions.
No one, however,
can anticipate all possible tasks that someone might want to perform,
so most programming languages allow the user to define new functions.
C is no exception and provides
for the creation of new and novel functions.
Of course,
to be useful,
these functions should be able to call
built-in functions as well as other programmer created
functions.
</p>
<p>For example, a function that determines whether a given
number is odd or even is not built into C but can be
quite useful in certain situations.
Here is a definition
of a function named <i>isEven</i> which returns true (integer 1) if the
given number is even, false (integer 0) otherwise:
</p>
<pre>
    int
    isEven(int n)
        {
        return n % 2 == 0;
        }
</pre>
<p>Even though this function definition is very short, there is a lot going on.
If you ever take a course on compilers, you will
learn how this code is turned into language your computer understands.
We, however, will stay on
a higher plane.
First, we will talk
about the
purpose of a function definition.
Later, we'll
talk about the
syntax of a function definition.
Finally,
will talk about the mechanics of a function definition
and a function call.
</p>

<h2><a name="id1">The purpose of functions</a></h2><p>
C programming is all about functions. We define a function to do some
task. This function calls other functions, some that are built-in and
some that are not. For those that are not, we define those as well.
These newly defined, lower-level functions, in turn, call more functions,
some that are built-in and some that are not.
And so it goes, until our lowest-level functions
call only built-in functions or functions we have previously defined.
</p>
<p>Even in higher-level languages, such as Java, the same process holds
as well. So learning to be comfortable with defining and calling functions
is paramount to being a good programmer and to being a good Computer Scientist.
Consider functions the language of Computer Scientists.
</p>

<h2><a name="id2">Function syntax</a></h2><p>
Recall that the words of a programming language include its
primitives, keywords and variables. A function definition
corresponds to a sentence in the language in that it is
built up from the words of the language. And like human
languages, the sentences must follow a certain form. This
specification of the form of a sentence is known as its
<i>syntax</i>. Computer Scientists often use a special way
of describing syntax of a programming language called the
Backus-Naur form (or Bnf). Here is a simplfied description
of the syntax of a C function definition using Bnf:
</p>
<pre>
    functionDefinition : signature block
    
    signature : type VARIABLE OPEN_PARENTHESIS parameterList CLOSE_PARENTHESIS

    parameterList : VOID
                  | type variable [COMMA type variable]*

    block : OPEN_BRACE statement+ CLOSE_BRACE
</pre>
<p>In Bnf,
the items in all capital letters represent the words and punctuation
in the program.
A plus sign means "one or more" while an asterisk means
"zero or more". A question mark, not shown in this example,
means "zero or one".
The first Bnf <i>rule</i> says that a function definition is
composed of two pieces, a <i>signature</i> followed by a <i>block</i>,
the more formal name for a function body.
The <i>signature</i>, discussed previously, starts
with a type of some kind,
followed by a variable,
followed by an open parenthesis, followed by a parameter
list,
and finally followed by a close
parenthesis.
The <i>parameterList</i> rule tells us that
the formal parameters in the function signature
consist of either the keyword <code>void</code> (which signifies no formal
parameters)
or a <i>type</i> followed by a <i>variable</i>. If there is
more than one formal paramter, they are separated by
a comma.
A <i>block</i> is composed of an open brace,
followed by 
one or more <i>statements</i>, and
ending with a close brace.
</p>
<p>As we can see from the Bnf rules,
formal parameters are variables that will be bound
to the values supplied in the function call.
In the particular case of <i>isEven</i>, from the
previous section,
the variable <i>x</i> will be bound to the number whose
evenness is to be determined. As noted earlier,
it is customary to call <i>x</i>
a <i>formal parameter</i> of the function <i>isEven</i>.
</p>

<h2><a name="id3">The syntax of function calls</a></h2><p>
Once a function is defined,
it is used by <i>calling</i> the
function with <i>arguments</i>.
A function is called by supplying
the name of the function followed by a parenthesized,
comma separated, list of expressions.
Those expressions may be literals, variables,
array accesses, function calls, combinations thereof, and more.
</p>
<p>In Bnf,  a description of a function call would look like:
</p>
<pre>
    functionCall : ID OPAREN argumentList? CPAREN

    argumentList : expression [COMMA expression]*
</pre>
<p>Here are some calls to the <i>isEven</i> function defined
above:
</p>
<pre>
    x = isEven(y);
    process(isEven(q+r),s);
    a = isEven(isEven(b));
</pre>
<p>Note that the formal paramaters include a type, but the arguments
do not.
In Computer Science speak, we say that the values
of the arguments are <i>bound</i> to
the
formal parameters during the processing of a function call.
</p>
<p>In general, if there are <i>n</i> formal parameters,
there should be <i>n</i> arguments.<sup><a href="index_26.html#footnote-23">23</a></sup>
Furthermore, the value of the
first argument is bound to the first formal parameter, the
second argument is bound to the second formal parameter,
and so on. Moreover, all the arguments are evaluated
before being bound to any of the parameters.
If an argument is a literal, the corresponding
formal parameter is bound to that literal value.
If an argument is more complicated, C determines
the value of that more complicated expression before
the formal parameter receives it.
</p>
<p>Once the evaluated arguments are bound to the parameters,
then the body of the function is evaluated. Most times,
the expressions in the body of the function will reference
various variables, some of which may be the formal parameters,
while some may not. For those that are not formal parameters,
how does C find the
values of those variables? That question is answered in
<a href="index_15.html">the chapter on scope</a>.
</p>

<h2><a name="id4">Returning from functions</a></h2><p>
Usually, the evaluation of a function body proceeds, statement by statement,
until there are no more statements or when a return
statement is encountered.
If the return statement has an expression,
the value of that expression is determined and becomes the
return value of the function.
The return value should match the return type of the function.
</p>
<p>A function body may have more than one return statement;
the first one <i>reached</i> wins.
Look at this example:
</p>
<pre>
    int
    safeDivide(int x,int y)
        {
        if (y == 0)             //conditional
            return 0;
        else
            return x / y;
        }
</pre>
<p>We haven't covered conditional statements yet,
but the code is easy enough to read.
When this function is called,
if the value of the second argument, which will be bound to <i>y</i>,
is equal to zero, then the function returns zero. If
not, then the function returns the value of the first argument,
bound to <i>x</i>, divided by the value of the second, bound do <i>y</i>.
</p>
<p>When a return statement is processed, execution of the function
body terminates. Thus, it is possible that some statements in
the function can never be processed. For example, consider this
version of <i>safeDivide</i>:
</p>
<pre>
    int
    safeDivide(int x,int y)
        {
        if (y == 0)             //conditional
            return 0;
        else
            return x / y;

        return 1;               //not reached
        }
</pre>
<p>Since either <i>y</i> is zero or it is not, one of the two returns
in the <code>if</code> statement must be reached. Once either is reached,
the processing of the function body terminates.
Therefore, the return statement at the end of the function
can never be reached.
</p>

<h2><a name="id5">Changing arguments using the procedure pattern</a></h2><p>
Consider writing a function to swap two values:
</p>
<pre>
    void
    swap(int x,int y)
        {
        int temp = x;   //line 1
        x = y;          //line 2
        y = temp;       //line 3
        }
</pre>
<p>The function, as written, correctly swaps the values of the formal
parameters <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>. But can we use the function to swap the values
of variables passed to the function? For example, what does the
following code fragment produce?
</p>
<pre>
    //test (with swap defined)
    int a = 4;
    int b = 23;
    printf("a was %d, b was %d\n",a,b);
    swap(a,b);
    printf("a now is %d, b now is %d\n",a,b);
</pre>
<p>Surprisingly, we get the following output:
</p>
<pre>
    a was 4, b was 23
    a now is 4, b now is 23
</pre>
<p>Even though <i>swap</i> correctly swaps the values of the formal parameters,
the arguments to <i>swap</i> remained unchanged. If we look at memory, we can
see why. Just before <i>swap</i> is called, both <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>
refer to memory initialized to 4 and 23, respectively:
</p>
<div align="center">
<img scale=0.50 alt="" src="pic-functions1.png"/>
</div>
<p>When swap is called, the space for the formal parameters is
allocated and the formal parameters are given their initial
values:
</p>
<div align="center">
<img scale=0.50 alt="" src="pic-functions2.png"/>
</div>
<p>As the body of <i>swap</i> runs, the variable <i>temp</i> is created
(line 1)
and initialized to the value of <i>x</i>:
</p>
<div align="center">
<img scale=0.50 alt="" src="pic-functions3.png"/>
</div>
<p>After <i>x</i> gets the value of <i>y</i> (line 2), we have:
</p>
<div align="center">
<img scale=0.50 alt="" src="pic-functions4.png"/>
</div>
<p>After <i>y</i> gets the value of <i>temp</i> (line 3), we have:
</p>
<div align="center">
<img scale=0.50 alt="" src="pic-functions5.png"/>
</div>
<p>We see that <i>swap</i> has indeed swapped the values 
of the formal parameters. At this point, swap returns
and the space allocated for <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, and <i>temp</i> is reclaimed
by the system. Note that through this whole process, the variables
<i>a</i> and <i>b</i> remain unchanged.
</p>
<p>So how do we get a function to swap the values of <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>? We do
so by passing the addresses of <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> to the <i>swap</i> function.
Here is the new version of <i>swap</i>:
</p>
<pre>
    void
    swap2(int *x,int *y)
        {
        int temp = *x;
        *x = *y;
        *y = temp;
        }
</pre>
<p>Taking the address of a variable creates a pointer. Hence, the formal
parameters need to be declared <code>int *</code> (pointer to <code>int</code>). Note
the formals <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> look the same as if we passed in an array of
integers to each. In fact, C does not know the difference, which is
why you must pass in the size of an array to a function when you pass an array
to that function. If you wanted to, you could consider <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> to be
arrays of a single element each, so an alternative, but
equivalent, version of <i>swap</i> would be:
</p>
<pre>
    void
    swap3(int *x,int *y)
        {
        int temp = x[0];
        x[0] = y[0];
        y[0] = temp;
        }
</pre>
<p>We will stick with the <i>swap2</i> version,
since that is how 99.999&#37; of the world would
write <i>swap</i>.
</p>
<p>To call <i>swap</i>, we send the addresses of the variables whose values
are to be swapped:
</p>
<pre>
    //test (with swap2 defined)
    int a = 4;
    int b = 23;
    printf("a was %d, b was %d\n",a,b);
    swap(&amp;a,&amp;b);
    printf("a now is %d, b now is %d\n",a,b);
</pre>
<p>Now, we get the results we desire:
</p>
<pre>
    a was 4, b was 23
    a now is 23, b now is 4
</pre>
<p>Let's look again at memory while our code is running. This time, since we
are manipulating addresses, we will pay attention to the addresses of
<i>a</i> and <i>b</i>.
For illustration, we will assume the value of <i>a</i> is stored at memory
location 1002, while <i>b</i>'s value is stored at location 1010.
Here is the state of memory just before <i>swap2</i> is called:
</p>
<div align="center">
<img scale=0.50 alt="" src="pic-functions6.png"/>
</div>
<p>When <i>swap2</i> is called, formal parameters <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are
initialized to the address of <i>a</i> and the address of <i>b</i>,
respectively:
</p>
<div align="center">
<img scale=0.50 alt="" src="pic-functions7.png"/>
</div>
<p>Next, the body of <i>swap2</i> is executed, causing the variable <i>temp</i> to be
created. The line:
</p>
<pre>
    int temp = *x;
</pre>
<p>says, "Don't initialize <i>temp</i> with the value of <i>x</i>.
Instead, intialize <i>temp</i>
to the value at the <i>address</i> found in <i>x</i>."
This leaves memory looking like:
</p>
<div align="center">
<img scale=0.50 alt="" src="pic-functions8.png"/>
</div>
<p>Now, the line:
</p>
<pre>
    *x = *y;
</pre>
<p>is executed.
This line says, "Don't update <i>x</i> with the value of <i>y</i>. Instead, update
the <i>address</i> found in <i>x</i> with the value at the address
found in <i>y</i>."
Now, memory looks like:
</p>
<div align="center">
<img scale=0.50 alt="" src="pic-functions9.png"/>
</div>
<p>Finally, the line:
</p>
<pre>
    *y = temp;
</pre>
<p>is executed.
This line says, "Don't update <i>y</i> with the value of <i>temp</i>.
Instead, update
the <i>address</i> found in <i>y</i> with the value of 
<i>temp</i>."
After this update, memory looks like:
Now, memory looks like:
</p>
<div align="center">
<img scale=0.50 alt="" src="pic-functions10.png"/>
</div>
<p>At this point,
<i>swap2</i> returns and we see that the values of <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>
have been exchanged, as desired.
</p>

<h2><a name="id6">Functions that "return" multiple items</a></h2><p>
The C language is limited somewhat because a function can return
only one thing.
However,
sometimes you need more than one piece of information
from a function. Consider a function which returns a dynamically
allocated array of a random length:
</p>
<pre>
    int *
    randomlySizedIntegerArray(void)
        {
        int size;
        char **array;

        size = random() % 100 + 1; //size will be between 1 and 100
        array = malloc(sizeof(int) * size); //check for malloc failure omitted

        return ???
        }
</pre>
<p>What should this function return? It can return the array, but without
knowing the size, the caller of this function won't know how many slots
are in the array it is receiving. The function can return the size, but
then the caller will not have access to the array. One solution is
to return the array, but require the caller to pass the address of
a variable; that variable will be updated by the function, much
like the <i>swap2</i> function in the previous section updated variables
supplied by the caller.
Here is a possible implementation:
</p>
<pre>
    int *
    randomlySizedIntegerArray(int *size)
        {
        int *array;

        *size = random() % 100 + 1; //size will be between 1 and 100
        array = malloc(sizeof(int) * *size); //check for malloc failure omitted

        return array;
        }
</pre>
<p>A caller of this function would pass in the address of the variable that is
to hold the randomly generated size:
</p>
<pre>
    int arraySize;
    int *array;

    array = randomlySizedIntegerArray(&amp;arraySize); //pass in address of arraySize
    //arraySize now holds the size of the array
</pre>
<p>This is an important rule to
remember:
<i>you cannot change the value of a variable by passing it to a function</i>.
If you wish to change its value, you must pass the address of the variable. 
An easy way to write such functions is to first assume a value is
being sent, as in the original, non-working, <i>swap</i> function. Then,
for every formal parameter that is to receive an address, place an
asterisk before all occurences in the function signature and
the function body. Then, place an ampersand before the variable in
the function call.
If you do this for <i>swap</i>,
you end up with the correctly working <i>swap2</i>.
By following this advice, you will ensure proper updates to
any variable whose address is to be sent to the function.
</p>

<h2><a name="id7">Function pointers</a></h2><p>
In the same way we can have a variable point to an array, we can
have a variable that points to a function. Suppose with have a
function whose signature is:
</p>
<pre>
    char *getString(int,double);
</pre>
<p>The function <i>getString</i> is a function that,
when passed an integer and a double
in that order, returns a string.
To create a variable named <i>g</i> that can point to this function, we start
with the function signature,
wrapping the name of the function in the signature with
parentheses:
</p>
<pre>
    char *(getString)(int,double);
</pre>
<p>Then,
we place an star in front of the function name (inside the parentheses
we just added):
</p>
<pre>
    char *(*getString)(int,double);
</pre>
<p>Finally, we
substitute the variable name <i>g</i> for the function name <i>getString</i>:
</p>
<pre>
    char *(*g)(int,double);
</pre>
<p>Given the original signature and this definition of g (plus a definition of
<i>getString</i> somewhere), we can do this:
</p>
<pre>
    char *getString(int,double);  //function prototype for getString
    char *(*g)(int,double);       //creating a function pointer named g
    g = getString;                //getString is NOT called here
    char *s = g(2,3.3);           //getString IS called here
</pre>
<p>The type of variable <i>g</i> is <code>char *(*)(int,double)</code>,
and we will refer to this as the <i>long form</i> of a function pointer.
This long form is rather unwieldy to type over and over, so we can use
the <i>typedef</i> mechanism to create a shorthand for this type.
If we add the keyword <code>typedef</code> in front of the type and change
the variable name <i>g</i> to a name that represents the new type:
</p>
<pre>
    typedef char *(*FPtr)(int,double);
</pre>
<p>we can make a new type called <code>FPtr</code>; this new
type can
be used to define variables that
point to functions like <i>getString</i>:
</p>
<pre>
    typedef char *(*FPtr)(int,double);  //creating a type named FPtr
    char *getString(int,double);        //function prototype for getString
    FPtr g;                             //creating a function pointer named g
    g = getString;                      //getString is NOT called here
    char *s = g(2,3.3);                 //getString IS called here
</pre>
<p>We will refer to the typedef'ed version of the function pointer as
the <i>short form</i>.
</p>
<p>With function pointers, we can now pass functions as arguments and
return functions as return values.
When passing a function like <i>getString</i> as an argument,
the accepting formal parameter
can be declared with the long form or the short form:
</p>
<pre>
    int f(char *(*u)(int,double));  //long form formal parameter
    int g(FPtr v);                  //short form formal parameter
    ...
    int x = f(getString);           //call to function f, passing getString
    int y = g(getString);           //call to function g, passing getString
</pre>
<p>Presumably,
functions <i>f</i> and <i>g</i> call <i>getString</i> via the formal parameters
<i>u</i> and <i>v</i>, respectively.
</p>
<p>When defining a function <i>h</i> that returns a function like <i>getString</i>,
we must use the short form to specify the return type:
</p>
<pre>
    FPtr g(void) { return getString; }
    ...
    FPtr h = g();
</pre>
<p>We will make use of function
pointers when we explore the <i>map pattern</i> in
the
<a href="index_16.html">Loops chapter</a>.
