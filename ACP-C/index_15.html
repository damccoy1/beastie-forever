<h1>Scope</h1>
<p>A <i>scope</i> holds the current set of variables and their values.
In C, there is something called the <i>global scope</i>.
The global scope holds all the values of the built-in variables
and function names (remember, a function name is  a pseudopointer,
similar to a variable).
</p>
<p>When you analyze a C program, either by compiling and running it
or by reading it,
you start out in the global scope.
As you come across definitions of variables<sup><a href="index_26.html#footnote-28">28</a></sup> and functions, their names and their values are added
to the global scope.
</p>
<p>Both variables and functions can be defined in the global scope.
Processing of the following code adds the names <i>x</i> and <i>main</i>
to the global scope:
</p>
<pre>
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

    //this is the global scope

    int x = 3;                  //x is bound to 3

    int
    main(int argc,char **argv)  //main is bound to a function object
        {
        ...
        return 0;
        }
</pre>
<p>This interaction adds two names to the global scope:
</p>
<pre>
    //this is the global scope
    int y = 4;

    int
    negate(int z)
        {
        return -z;
        }
</pre>
<p>What are the two names?
Highlight the following line to see the answer:
</p>
<div class="quote">
<i>The two names added to the global scope are</i> <font color="#ffffff"> y and negate.</font>
</div>
<p>Indeed, since functions are defined in the global scope,
and the name <i>negate</i>
is being bound to a function object, it becomes clear that
this binding is occurring in the
global scope, just like <i>y</i> being bound to 4.
</p>
<p>Scopes in C can be identified by <i>block nesting level</i>.
The global scope holds all variables defined with an nesting
level of zero or, in other words, not within a block.
Recall that when functions are defined, the body of the function
is contained in a block.
Thus, the function body is code that is nested within the global
scope and constitutes
a new scope, with a nesting level of one.
We can identify to which scope a variable belongs by
looking at the pattern of nesting.
In particular,
we label variables as 
either <i>local</i> or <i>non-local</i>
with respect to a particular scope.
Moreover, we can label non-local variables as <i>in scope</i> or
<i>out of scope</i>.
</p>

<h2><a name="id1">In Scope or Out</a></h2><p>
The nesting pattern of a program can tells us where
variables are visible (in scope) and where they are
not (out of scope).
We begin by first learning to recognizing the scopes in which variables
are defined.
</p>

<h3><a name="id2">The Local Variable Pattern</a></h3><p>
All variables <i>defined</i> at a particular
nesting level or scope are considered
<i>local</i> to that nesting level or scope.
In C, if one defines a variable, that variable
must be local to the current scope.
An exception are the formal parameters of a function definition;
these
belong to the scope that is identified with
the function body. 
So within a function body, the local variables are the formal
parameters plus any variables defined immediately within the function body.
</p>
<p>Let's look at an example.
Note,
you do not need to completely understand the examples presented in
the rest of the chapter in order 
to identify whether names are local and non-local.
</p>
<pre>
    //this is the global scope
    int
    theta(int a,int b)
        {
        //this is a non-global scope
        int c,d;
        c = a + b;
        c = kappa(c) + X;
        d = c * c + a;
        return d * b;
        }
</pre>
<p>In this example, we can immediately say the 
formal parameters,
<i>a</i> and <i>b</i>,
are local with respect to the scope of the body of function <i>theta</i>.
Furthermore, variables
<i>c</i> and <i>d</i>
are defined in the function body
so they are local as well,
with respect to the scope of the body of function <i>theta</i>.
It is rather wordy to say "local with respect to the
scope of the body of the function <i>theta</i>", so Computer Scientists
will almost always shorten this to "local with respect to <i>theta</i>"
or just "local"
if it is clear the discussion is about a particular function or scope.
We will use this shortened phrasing from here on out.
Thus <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, and <i>d</i> are local with respect to <i>theta</i>.
The function name <i>theta</i> is local to the global scope since the function
<i>theta</i> is defined in the global scope.
</p>

<h3><a name="id3">The Non-local Variable Pattern</a></h3><p>
In the previous section, we determined the local
variables of the function.
By the process 
of elimination, that means the names
<i>kappa</i>, and <i>X</i> are non-local.
The name of function itself is non-local with respect
to its body. The name <i>theta</i>, if it is referenced with the body of
<i>theta</i> is non-local as well.
</p>
<p><i>In a function body, any variable that is not a formal parameter
and is also not defined immediately within the function body must be non-local.</i>
</p>

<h3><a name="id4">The Visible Variable Pattern</a></h3><p>
A variable is accessible or <i>visible</i> with respect to
a particular scope if it is <i>in scope</i>.
A variable is in scope if it is local or
was defined in a scope that
<i>encloses</i> the particular scope.
Some scope
<i>A</i> encloses some other scope <i>B</i>
if, by moving (perhaps repeatedly) leftward from
scope B, scope A can be reached.
Here is example:
</p>
<pre>
    int Z = 5;

    int
    iota(int x)
       {
       return x + Z;
       }
</pre>
<p>The variable <i>Z</i> is local with respect to the global scope
and is non-local with respect to <i>iota</i>. However, we can
move leftward from the scope of <i>iota</i> one nesting level and
reach the global scope where <i>Z</i> is defined.
Therefore, the global scope encloses the scope of <i>iota</i> and
thus <i>Z</i> is visible from <i>iota</i> and its value 
can be accessed within <i>iota</i>..
Indeed, the global scope encloses all other scopes and this
is why the built-in functions are accessible at any nesting
level.
</p>
<p>Here is another example that has two enclosing scopes:
</p>
<pre>
    int X = 3;

    int
    phi(int a)
        {
        int Y = a - 1;
        if (isEven(a))
            {
            int b = X + 1;
            return a * b;
            }
        else
            {
            return X * Y;
            }
        }
</pre>
<p>The global scope locally defines two names, <i>X</i> and <i>phi</i>.
If we look at function <i>phi</i>, we see that it has two local
variables, the formal parameter <i>a</i> and the locally defined
variable <i>Y</i>. In the <i>if</i> statement, we see that the true
branch is a block. This block is a new nesting level and
therefore a new scope.
This new scope has the locally defined variable <i>b</i>,
but references the non-local variable <i>X</i>.
The false branch is also a block and a new scope, but
it has no local variables.
However, it references the non-local variables
<i>X</i> and <i>Y</i>. 
</p>
<p>Are all these non-local variables accessible?
Consider the first non-local reference to <i>X</i>.
Moving leftward from the true branch of the <i>if</i>,
we reach the body of <i>phi</i>,
so the scope of <i>phi</i> encloses the scope of the true branch.
Moving leftward again, we reach the global scope, where <i>X</i> is
defined. Therefore, the global scope encloses (transitively) the
scope of the true branch, so X is visible and accessible within
the true branch.
For the same reasons, both <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> are visible and
accessible within the false branch of the <i>if</i>.
</p>
<p>In the next section, we explore how a variable can be
inaccessible.
</p>

<h3><a name="id5">The Tinted Windows Pattern</a></h3><p>
The scope of local variables is like a car with tinted
windows, with the variables defined within riding in
the back seat.
If you are outside the scope, you cannot
peer through the car windows  and see those variables.
You might try and buy some x-ray glasses, but they
probably wouldn't work.
Here is an example:
</p>
<pre>
    int
    alpha(int a)
        {
        if (isEven(a))
            {
            int b = a + 1;
            printf("%d\n",a * b);
            }
        printf("%d\n",b * 2);
        }
</pre>
<p>The print statement at the end of the function causes an error:
</p>
<pre>
    error: 'b' undeclared (first use in this function)
         printf("%d\n",b * 2);
                       ^
</pre>
<p>The rule for figuring out which variables are in scope and
which are not is:
<i>you</i> <b>cannot</b> <i>see into an enclosed scope</i>.
In the example, the scope of the <i>if</i> is enclosed by the
scope of <i>alpha</i>. Therefore, in <i>alpha</i>, any references to variables
local to the <i>if</i> block are invalid.
Contrast this with the non-local pattern:
In the <i>if</i> block, any references to variables 
local to <i>alpha</i> (and the global scope, by transitivity)
are valid.
</p>

<h3><a name="id6">Tinted Windows with Parallel Scopes</a></h3><p>
The tinted windows pattern also applies to parallel scopes.
Consider this code:
</p>
<pre>
    int
    gamma(int a)
        {
        return a + delta(a);
        }

    int
    delta(int x)
        {
        // starting point 1
        printf("the value of a is %d\n",a); //x-ray!
        return x + 1;
        }
</pre>
<p>Note that the global scope encloses both the scope of <i>gamma</i> and
the scope of <i>delta</i>. However, the scope of <i>gamma</i> does
not enclose the scope of <i>delta</i>. Neither does
the scope of <i>delta</i> enclose the scope of <i>gamma</i>.
</p>
<p>One of these functions references a variable that is not in scope.
Can you guess which one?
Highlight the following line to see the answer:
</p>
<div class="quote">
<i>The function</i> <font color="#ffffff"> delta</font> <i>references a variable not in scope.</i>
</div>
<p>Let's see why by first examining <i>gamma</i> to see whether or
not its non-local references are in scope.
The only local variable of function <i>gamma</i> is
<i>a</i>. The only referenced non-local is <i>delta</i>.
Moving leftward from the body of <i>gamma</i>, we reach the
global scope where where both <i>gamma</i> and <i>delta</i> are defined.
Therefore, <i>delta</i>
is visible with respect to <i>gamma</i> since it is defined in a scope
(the global scope) that encloses <i>gamma</i>.
</p>
<p>Now to investigate <i>delta</i>. The only local variable of
<i>delta</i> is <i>x</i>
and the only non-local that <i>delta</i> references is <i>a</i>.
Moving outward to the global scope, we see that there is
no variable <i>a</i> defined there,
therefore the variable <i>a</i> is not in scope with
respect to <i>delta</i>.
</p>
<p>When we actually run the code,
we get an error similar to the following when running this program:
</p>
<pre>
    error: 'a' undeclared (first use in this function)
        printf("the value of a is %d\n",a); //x-ray!
                                        ^
</pre>
<p>`
The lesson to be learned here is
that we cannot see into
the local scope of the body of function <i>gamma</i>,
<i>even if we are at a similar nesting level</i>.
Nesting level doesn't matter. We can only see variables
in our own scope and those in <i>enclosing</i> scopes.
All other variables cannot be seen.
</p>
<p>Therefore, if you ever see a variable-not-defined error,
you either have spelled the variable name wrong 
or you are trying to use x-ray vision
to see somewhere you can't. 
</p>

<h2><a name="id7">Alternate terminology</a></h2><p>
Sometimes, enclosed scopes are referred to as <i>inner</i> scopes while
enclosing scopes are referred to as <i>outer</i> scopes. In addition,
both locals and any non-locals found in enclosing scopes are considered
<i>accessible</i> or <i>visible</i> or <i>in scope</i>,
while non-locals that are not
found in an enclosing scope are considered <i>inaccessible</i>, or 
<i>not visible</i> or <i>out of scope</i>.
We will use all these terms in the remainder of the text book.
</p>

<h2><a name="id8">Three Scope Rules</a></h2><p>
Here are three simple rules you can use to help you
figure out the scope of a particular variable:
</p>
<ul><li>Formal parameters go in
</li><li>The function name goes out 
</li><li>You can see out but you can't see in (tinted windows).
</li></ul>
<p>The first rule is shorthand for the fact that formal parameters
belong to the scope of the function body. Since the function body
is "inside" the function definition, we can say the formal parameters
go in.
</p>
<p>The second rule reminds us that function names are defined
in the global scope, so they go out with respect to
the function body.
</p>
<p>The third rule tells us all the variables that belong to 
ever-enclosing scopes are accessible and therefore
can be referenced by the innermost scope. The opposite is
not true. A variable in an enclosed scope can not be referenced
by an enclosing scope. If you forget the directions of this
rule, think of tinted windows. You can see out of a tinted
window, but you can't see in.
</p>

<h2><a name="id9">Shadowing</a></h2><p>
Consider the rule that
says that references to variables or names in an outer scope
are visible.
There is one exception to that rule;
consider the following code fragment:
</p>
<pre>
    int a = 4;

    void
    epsilon(int a)
        {
        printf("a is %d\n",a);
        return;
        }
    ...
    epsilon(13);
    ...
</pre>
<p>In this example, the global scope defines two names,
<i>a</i> and <i>epsilon</i>.
The scope of the body of <i>epsilon</i> defines the name <i>a</i>.
When <i>epsilon</i> is called with some argument (in the example,
13), what is printed for the value of <i>a</i>, the value passed
in and bound to the formal parameter <i>a</i> or the value of the
global variable <i>a</i>?
</p>
<p>If we write a program around this code fragment, we see the
following output:
</p>
<pre>
    a is 13
</pre>
<p>Clearly, the C compiler preferred the formal parameter over
the global version. The reason is, when resolving the
value of a variable, the most local scope is searched for
a binding for that name. Should the local scope not hold
a binding, the immediate enclosing scope is searched.
If no binding is found there, the enclosing scope of <i>that</i>
scope is search and so on, until the global scope is reached.
Should no binding be found in the global scope, an undefined variable error
is generated by the compiler.
</p>
<p>In the example, a binding for variable <i>a</i> is found in the local scope
and the value found there is retrieved for the print statement.
As a consequence, it is impossible to retrieve the value of the
global binding for <i>a</i>. It is said that the formal parameter
<i>shadows</i> the global variable. Being in the shadow of the formal
parameter means it cannot be seen.
In general, when a more local variable has the same name as a 
less local variable
that is also in scope, the more local variable 
shadows the less local version.
</p>
<p>In the example,
if you wished to reference both the global <i>a</i> and the formal parameter
<i>a</i>, you would need to rename the formal parameter.
</p>

<h2><a name="id10">Multiple definitions and declarations</a></h2><p>
C does not allow multiple definitions having the same name. Thus, one
cannot have two (or more) functions named the same or two variables in
the same scope with the same name.
On the other hand, one
can have multiple declarations. For example, it is perfectly legal
to repeat a function prototype/signature/declaration:
</p>
<pre>
    char *f(int,double);
    char *f(int,double); //duplicative, but OK
</pre>
<p>In contrast, the compiler complains about:
</p>
<pre>
    int square(int x) { return x * x; }
    int square(int x) { return x * x; } //duplicative and illegal
</pre>
<p>Variables work the same way, except there is a slight wrinkle in C.
In the global scope, the following is legal in C:
</p>
<pre>
    int x;
    int x; //duplicative, but OK in the global scope
</pre>
<p>The C compiler interprets one of the lines as a declaration and
the other as a definition. However, if the above lines were found in
a non-global scope, say a function body, the compiler would complain
about multiple definitions:
</p>
<pre>
    int almostSquare(int y)
        {
        int x;
        int x;        //duplicative and illegal
        x = y - 1;
        return x * y;
        }
</pre>
<p>Within a non-global scope, both lines are considered definitions, thus
violating the multiple definition rule for C.
One can avoid the multiple definition error in a non global scope by
explicitly stating that one of the lines is a declaration. This is
accomplished with the <code>extern</code> keyword:
</p>
<pre>
    int almostSquare(int y)
        {
        int x;
        extern int x;        //OK
        x = y - 1;
        return x * y;
        }
</pre>
<p>Initializing a variable forces the compiler to treat a potential declaration
as a definition. In the global scope:
</p>
<pre>
   int x = 13;   //definition
   int x;        //declaration
</pre>
<p>the first line must be interpreted as a definition as the variable is
initialized. To avoid a multiply defined variable error, the compiler
interprets the second line as a declaration. However, the following
is illegal in all scopes:
</p>
<pre>
    int x = 13; //definition
    int x = 13; //also a definition, therefore illegal
</pre>
<p>Do not tag a variable as <code>extern</code> and initialize it at the same time:
</p>
<pre>
    extern int x = 100; //don't ever do this
</pre>
<p>If you do this, you are telling the compiler this is only a declaration,
not a definition
(via <code>extern</code>), but at the same time, you are telling the compiler this is
a definition (via the initialization). 
</p>
<p>You might be thinking, this is really a non-issue since nobody in
his or her right mind would define/declare the same variable
in the same scope. Such a situation, it turns out, happens quite
commonly. Suppose a file named <i>c.h</i> contains the following line:
</p>
<pre>
    int x;
</pre>
<p>and both module <i>a.c</i> and <i>b.c</i> include <i>c.h</i>.
Then <i>a.c</i> and <i>b.c</i> are compiled
together to make the executable:
</p>
<pre>
    gcc -Wall a.c b.c
</pre>
<p>To the compiler, definitions in both a.c and b.c are all in the global
scope, so the compiler sees two declarations of <i>x</i>, since <i>c.h</i> is
included in both. The compiler turns one of those declarations into
a definition and everything works.
However, if the line in <i>c.h</i> is changed to:
</p>
<pre>
    int x = 100;
</pre>
<p>then the compiler, when compiling <i>a.c</i> and <i>b.c</i> together, sees
two definitions of <i>x</i> and emits a compiler error.
</p>
<p>To sum all this up in two simple rules, we have:
</p>
<ol><li>Never initialize a variable in a <i>.h</i> file
</li><li>If a global variable is used across modules, only
initialize the variable in one module.
</li></ol>
