<h1>Strings</h1>
<p>As stated in a previous chapter, strings in C are really arrays of characters.
For example, the two variables <i>s1</i> and <i>s2</i> are very similar:
</p>
<pre>
    //test
    char *s1 = "hello";
    char s2[6] = { 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '\0' };
    printf("%s\n",s1);
    printf("%s\n",s2);
</pre>
<p>Both print statements produce the word <code>hello</code>. The difference is that <i>s1</i> is 
a true pointer while <i>s2</i> is a pseudopointer.
We can tell this by the types of <i>s1</i> and <i>s2</i>.
The variable <i>s1</i> has a type <code>char *</code>, which
means it holds an address of a memory location that stores a character.
The variable <i>s2</i> has the type <code>char[6]</code>.
Since <i>s1</i> is a true
pointer, it can point to any number of different characters.  The program above points it
to the first character in the literal <tt>hello</tt> but that can be updated
and point to different locations as the program executes.
On the other hand, <i>s2</i> will always refer to (first of) the six characters that were
allocated to it.  While the characters might change, the location that <i>s2</i>
references will never change.
</p>
<p>A strange thing in the code above is that <i>s2</i> is an array of six characters
while the counting the characters between the quotes in the initializer for
<i>s1</i>, <code>"hello"</code>, yields
five.
It appears the sixth
slot of <i>s2</i>
(at index 5, remember your zero-based counting!) is initialized to a rather
funny looking character <code>'\0'</code>. This character is sometimes
pronounced <i>backslash-zero</i> or, more often, the <i>null character</i> or
the <i>null byte</i>.
In C, strings are terminated by the null character, so both <i>s1</i> and <i>s2</i>
in our example point to arrays of six slots:
</p>
<div align="center">
<img scale=0.50 alt="" src="pic-strings1.png"/>
</div>
<p>For <i>s1</i>, the C compiler adds on terminating null characters to
literal strings such as <code>"hello"</code>.
When we build a string with an array ourselves, we are in charge of getting
things right. We must be mindful not to forget
to both make room for the null character and place it into the array.
</p>
<p>Note: you can safely allocate a static array of characters, making
sure there is room for the null character with initializations like:
</p>
<pre>
    char s3[] = "hello";
</pre>
<p>When you do this, the C compiler will determine the length of the string and
allocate space for all the characters in the string plus the <i>null</i> character.
</p>

<h2><a name="id1">Printing strings</a></h2><p>
When we wish to print a string, we use the <code>%s</code> format
directive in the guide string:
</p>
<pre>
    //test
    char *s = "The integer directive is %d";
    printf("%s\n",s);               //should print: The integer directive is %d
</pre>
<p>Often, we wish to build a guide string and use it in a print statement:
</p>
<pre>
    //test
    int z = 5;
    char *s = "The result is %d\n";
    printf(s,z*z);                  //should print: The result is 25
</pre>
<p>From this example, we can see that <i>printf</i> (indeed, all functions) are quite flexible in
terms of what kinds of data we can send it. For the guide string, we can send a literal
string, a character pointer, or an array of characters. Of course, with the latter
two, the array of characters has to be terminated with the null character.
</p>
<p>One difference between literal strings and arrays of characters
is that one can change a character in an array of characters using bracket
notation. For literal strings, attempting to change a character will
cause undefined behavior. For example:
</p>
<pre>
    char *r = "rat";                    //r points to a literal string
    char s[] = { 'r', 'a', 't', '\0'};  //s pseudopoints to an array of char
    char *t = r;                        //t points to a literal string
    char *u = s;                        //u points to an array of char

    r[0] = 'c';     //BAD
    s[0] = 'c';     //OK
    t[0] = 'c';     //BAD
    u[0] = 'c';     //OK
</pre>
<p>From the code above, we can see it doesn't matter if we use the
name of an array or a pointer to the same array; we are allowed to
change the contents of the array. Likewise, we are <i>not</i> allowed to
change the contents of a literal string, regardless of how we access it.
</p>

<h2><a name="id2">Determining string length</a></h2><p>
C has a built-in function for determining the length of a string, <i>strlen</i>.
The <i>strlen</i> function returns the number of characters in the given
string, <i>not counting the null character</i>. For example,
</p>
<pre>
    //test
    char s[6] = { 'w', 'o', 'r', 'l', 'd', '\0' };
    char *t = "world";
    //calculate!
    printf("the length of s is %zu\n",strlen(s));
    printf("the length of t is %zu\n",strlen(t));
</pre>
<p>The output of the above code is:
</p>
<pre>
    the length of s is 5
    the length of t is 5
</pre>
<p>There are actually six characters in <i>s</i> and <i>t</i>,
so when using <i>strlen</i>
to compute the length of the string, remember to add in one more
to account for the null character.
</p>
<p>A quick question for you regarding <i>strelen</i>.  In the example above,
what character does <tt>s[strlen(s)]</tt> reference?  Is it the last
character in the array (`d') or the <tt>null</tt> character?  Since arrays start
counting at zero, it is always important that you account for this
when using <i>strlen</i>.
</p>
<p>You likely noticed the use of the <code>%zu</code> format specifier 
in the guide string
to look at the return value of <i>strlen</i>.
Like <i>sizeof</i>, <i>strlen</i> returns an integer on a 32-bit machine and
a long(er) integer on a 64-bit machine.
</p>
<p>In order for <i>strlen</i> to work properly on character arrays, they must be terminated
by the null character. Consider this code:
</p>
<pre>
    char s[5] = { 'w', 'o', 'r', 'l', 'd' };
    printf("the length of s is %zu\n",strlen(s));
</pre>
<p>The result of running the <i>strlen</i> function in this case
is undefined. This is because <i>strlen</i>
will count characters until it encounters the null character. Since there is no
null character specified,
<i>strlen</i> will cruise through memory until it finds one
accidentally. If it finds one, it will report an erroneous length,
If it doesn't find one, your program will crash.
</p>

<h2><a name="id3">Copying strings</a></h2><p>
Sometimes it is useful to copy a string.
The following code does not copy. Rather,
it sets up an alias:
</p>
<pre>
    //test
    char *s = "rat";
    char *t = s;                //t is an alias for s
    printf("%s\n",t);           //should print: rat
</pre>
<p>To make a copy, we need to allocate an array and then use the
<i>strncpy</i> function to
copy the string into the array. The <i>strncpy</i> function takes
an array that receives the characters being copied,
the string to be copied, and
an integer that limits the number of characters to be copied.
Here is an example:
</p>
<pre>
    //test
    char *s = "rat";
    char t[4];
    //calculate!
    strncpy(t,s,4);         //magic number, s has four characters!
    t[0] = 'c';             //OK, t is an array
    printf("%s\n",s);       //should print rat
    printf("%s\n",t);       //should print cat
</pre>
<p>Here the output of the first print statement is <code>rat</code>, showing that changing the first
character of <i>t</i> had no effect on <i>s</i>.
The second print statement produces <code>cat</code>, indicating
that the copy performed by <i>strncpy</i> worked.
</p>
<p>One common mistake made with this kind of code is to specifiy one less character
than necessary in specifying the number of characters to be copied, i.e.,
forgetting to count the null character. A better version uses <i>strlen</i>:
</p>
<pre>
    strncpy(t,s,strlen(s)+1);   //add 1 for the null byte
</pre>
<p>A second common mistake is to allocate the
destination array with too few slots.
A safer version of this code copies as many characters
as allowed, then writes a null byte in the last slot of array:
</p>
<pre>
    strncpy(t,s,SLOTS(t));
    t[SLOTS(t)-1] = '\0';
</pre>
<p>Even this code is problematic, in that if <i>t</i> is too small,
the string in <i>t</i> will be a prefix of the string in <i>s</i>:
</p>
<pre>
    //test
    #define SLOTS(a) (sizeof(a)/sizeof(*a))
    char *s = "rat";
    char t[3];              //t is too small!
    //calculate!
    strncpy(t,s,SLOTS(t));
    t[SLOTS(t)-1] = '\0';
    printf("%s\n",s);       //should print rat
    printf("%s\n",t);       //should print ra
</pre>
<p>Instead of using a statically allocated array to hold a string, we can
use a dynamically allocated array:
</p>
<pre>
    //test
    char *s = "rat";
    char *t = malloc(strlen(s) + 1); //remember the null character!
    // check to see that malloc was successful
    if (t == 0)
        {
        fprintf(stderr,"allocation of t failed\n");
        exit(1);
        }
    //calculate!
    strncpy(t,s,strlen(s) + 1);
    t[0] = 'c';             //OK, t points to an array
    printf("%s\n",s);       //should print rat
    printf("%s\n",t);       //should print cat
</pre>
<p>The use of dynamic allocation solves all our problems!
</p>
<p>One final note on copying strings.  We used the <tt>strncpy</tt> routine and
specifically watched how many characters were being copied.  There is also a
<tt>strcpy</tt> routine that simply copies a string without doing any checking
to make sure you have the space necessary to make the copy.  Since one of
the easiest ways to get in trouble with C programming is to overwrite
something, we recommend you always make sure you have room to store whatever
it is that you are copying.
</p>

<h2><a name="id4">Comparing strings</a></h2><p>
Can one string be "less than" another, in the same way that one number can
be less than another? It turns out the answer is yes. In fact, the ability
to say one string is less than another allows us to quickly look up words
in a dictionary<sup><a href="index_26.html#footnote-20">20</a></sup>.
In a dictionary, the word <i>aardvark</i> comes before <i>zebra</i>,
because the letter
<i>a</i>, which starts aardvark,
comes before <i>z</i>, which starts zebra, in the alphabet.
</p>
<p>If we were to ask:
</p>
<pre>
    //test
    char *w1 = "zebra";
    char *w2 = "aardvark";
    printf("%d\n",w2 &lt; w1);     //may print true: 1, but likely false: 0
</pre>
<p>the output may surprise us. This is because we did not ask whether
<i>w2</i> comes before <i>w1</i>
in the dictionary.
Recall that <i>w1</i> and <i>w2</i> are pointers.
Thus, the question that we asked was is the address held in <i>w2</i>
less than the address held in <i>w1</i>.
</p>
<p>We have a special purpose operator/function for answering dictionary
questions. It is called <i>strcmp</i>. When given two strings, <i>strcmp</i>
returns 0 if they are composed of the same characters in the same order,
a negative
integer if the first string precedes the second in a dictionary, and
a positive integer if the first string follows the second:
</p>
<pre>
    //test
    char *w1 = "zebra";
    char *w2 = "aardvark";
    printf("%d\n",strcmp(w2,w1) &lt; 0);       //should print true: 1
</pre>
<p>We have thrown around the term <i>dictionary</i> rather cavalierly.
C's dictionary ordering is a bit different than what we are used to.
For example, in C's alphabet, a capital <i>Z</i> comes before a lower-case
<i>a</i>. Therefore,
when we capitalize <i>Zebra</i>:
</p>
<pre>
    //test
    char *w1 = "Zebra";
    char *w2 = "aardvark";
    printf("%d\n",strcmp(w2,w1) &lt; 0);       //should print false: 0
</pre>
<p>we get the opposite result from before.
</p>
<p>Several chapters ago, we mentioned an <tt>ASCII</tt> table for characters.
This table is what C uses for its ordering.  If you find this table online,
you can easily see why a capital-Z (<tt>ASCII</tt> value 90) is considered
less than a lowercase-a (<tt>ASCII</tt> value 97).
</p>

<h2><a name="id5">Converting strings to numbers</a></h2><p>
The function <i>atoi</i> can convert a string representing an integer to
an actual integer:
</p>
<pre>
    //test
    int i;
    char *s;
    //calculate!
    s = "123";
    i = atoi(s);
    printf("s+1 is %s\n",s+1);   //should print 23
    printf("i+1 is %d\n",i+1);   //should print 124
</pre>
<p>The first print statements prints 23 because <code>s+1</code> skips over
the first character. The second print 124 because <i>atoi</i> converts
the string <code>"123"</code> into the integer 123. Adding one to the
integer increments the value to 124. If you give <i>atoi</i> a string
that doesn't look like an integer, it will return 0.
</p>
<p>The <i>atof</i> function can be used to convert a string into a real number.
</p>
<pre>
    double r = atof("3.14159");
</pre>
<p>Like <i>atoi</i>,
if you give <i>atof</i> a string that does not look like a number,
it will return 0.0;
