<h1>Conditionals</h1>
<p>Conditionals implement decision points in a computer program.
Suppose you have a program that performs some task on an
image. You may well have a point in the program where you
do one thing if the image is a JPEG and quite another
thing if the image is a GIF file. Likely, at this point,
your program will include a conditional expression to make
this decision.
</p>
<p>Before learning about conditionals, it is important to
learn about logical expressions. Such expressions are the
core of conditionals and loops.<sup><a href="index_26.html#footnote-24">24</a></sup>
</p>

<h2><a name="id1">Logical expressions</a></h2><p>
A logical expression evaluates to a truth value, in essence true or
false. For example, the expression <i>x &gt; 0</i>
resolves to true if <i>x</i> is positive
and false if <i>x</i> is negative or zero. In C, falsehood is represented by
the integer 0 and truth
by any other integer, usually 1.
Recall that, together,
these two values are known as B<font size="-1">OOLEAN</font>&#32;values.
</p>
<p>One can assign truth values to integer variables:
</p>
<pre>
      //test
      int c = -1;
      int z = (c &gt; 0);
      printf("z is %d\n",z);     //should print z is 0
</pre>
<p>If <i>c</i> were positive,
the variable <i>z</i> would be assigned a value of 1, which is
interpreted as true.
Since <i>c</i> is negative, however, it is assigned a value of zero, which
is interpreted as false.
The parentheses are added to the comparison to improve readability.
</p>

<h2><a name="id2">Logical operators</a></h2><p>
Let's review C's logical operators:
</p>
<font color="#0000ff">
<div align="center">
<p><table><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" align="center">
<code>==</code>    </td><td colspan="1" align="left"> equal to </td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="1" align="center">
<code>!=</code>    </td><td colspan="1" align="left"> not equal to </td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="1" align="center">
<code>&gt;=</code>    </td><td colspan="1" align="left"> greater than or equal to </td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="1" align="center">
<code>&gt;</code>     </td><td colspan="1" align="left"> greater than </td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="1" align="center">
<code>&lt;</code>     </td><td colspan="1" align="left"> less than </td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="1" align="center">
<code>&lt;=</code>    </td><td colspan="1" align="left"> less than or equal to </td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="1" align="center">
<code>&amp;&amp;</code>    </td><td colspan="1" align="left"> <font size="-1"><b>AND</b></font>, both must be true </td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="1" align="center">
<code>||</code>    </td><td colspan="1" align="left"> <font size="-1"><b>OR</b></font>, one or both must be true </td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="1" align="center">
<code>!</code>     </td><td colspan="1" align="left"> a unary operator that reverses a truth value </td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="1" align="center">
</td></tr></tbody></table>
</p>
</div>
<font color="#000000">
<p>The first six operators are used for comparing two things,
while the next two operators are the glue that joins up simpler
logical expressions into more complex ones.
The last operator is used to reverse a logical value from true to false
and vice versa.
</p>
<p>Beginning programmers often confuse the <code>=</code> operator,
which is the assignment
operator, with the <code>==</code> operator, which is the equality operator.
Remember, assignment is used to change the value of a variable while
equality can be used to test the value of a variable (without 
changing its value).
Fortunately, the GNU C compiler detects many attempts to use assignment
when equality is intended and will complain appropriately.
</p>

<h2><a name="id3">Short circuiting</a></h2><p>
When evaluating a logical expression,
C evaluates the subexpressions from left to right and
stops evaluating as soon as it finds out that the entire expression
is definitely true or definitely false.
For example, when encountering the expression:
</p>
<pre>
      x != 0 &amp;&amp; y / x &gt; 2
</pre>
<p>if <i>x</i> has a value of 0, the subexpression on the left side of the
<font size="-1"><b>AND</b></font>
connective resolves to false. At this point, there is no way for the
entire expression to be true (since both the left hand side and the right
hand side must be true for an
<font size="-1"><b>AND</b></font>
expression to be true), so the right
hand side of the expression is not evaluated. Note that this particular 
expression
protects against a divide-by-zero error.
</p>
<p>Likewise, if the first subexpression in an
<font size="-1"><b>OR</b></font>
expression is true, then the
entire
<font size="-1"><b>OR</b></font>
expression is true and there is no need to evaluate the second expression
in the disjunction.
For example, if the call to function <i>f</i> returns
true, then the call to function <i>g</i> is never made:
</p>
<pre>
    f(x) || g(x,y)
</pre>

<h2><a name="id4">If expressions</a></h2><p>
C's <i>if</i> expressions are used to conditionally execute code,
depending on the truth value of what is known as the
<i>test</i> expression. One version of <i>if</i> has a single statement
following the test expression:
</p>
<p>Here is an example:
</p>
<pre>
    if (strcmp(name,"John") == 0)               //0 means the same
        printf("I like that name!");
</pre>
<p>In this version, when the test expression is true (<i>i.e.</i>, 
the statement following it is executed,
causing the compliment.
If the test expression is false, however the
following statement is not evaluated.
You can also use blocks. The following code is equivalent to the previous:
</p>
<pre>
    if (strcmp(name,"John") == 0)               //0 means the same
        {
        printf("I like that name!");
        }
</pre>
<p>The advantage of blocks is that you can have more the one statement evaluated
when the test expression is true. Novice programmers sometimes think that
indentation is sufficient, as in:
</p>
<pre>
    if (strcmp(name,"John") == 0)               //0 means the same
        printf("I like that name!");
        goodName = 1;
</pre>
<p>Since C doesn't care about indentation<sup><a href="index_26.html#footnote-25">25</a></sup>,
it assumes the assignment statement does not belong to the <i>if</i> at all
and <i>goodName</i> is set to 1 regardless of whether
<i>name</i> is <code>"John"</code> or not.
Some programmers always use blocks even if there is a single
statement to be executed. We will use that convention in this text,
unless we are trying to save space.
</p>
<p>Here is another form of <i>if</i>:
</p>
<pre>
    if (strcmp(major,"Computer Science") == 0)
        {
        print("Smart choice!")
        }
    else
        {
        print("Ever think about changing your major?")
        }
</pre>
<p>In this version, <i>if</i> has two blocks, one following the
test expression and one following the <i>else</i> keyword.
As before, the first block is evaluated if the test expression
is true. If the test expression is false, however,
the second block is evaluated instead.
Also as before, if the blocks have a single statement, the
braces can be omitted.
</p>

<h2><a name="id5">if-elseif-else chains</a></h2><p>
You can chain <i>if</i> statements together using the <i>else</i> keyword,
followed by an <i>if</i> statement,
as in:
</p>
<pre>
    if (bases == 4)
        {
        printf("HOME RUN!!!\n");
        }
    else if (bases == 3)
        {
        printf("TrIpLe!!\n");
        }
    else if (bases == 2)
        {
        printf("Double!\n");
        }
    else if (bases == 1) 
        {
        printf("single\n");
        }
    else
        {
        printf("out\n");
        }
</pre>
<p>The block that is eventually evaluated is
directly underneath the first test expression
that is true, reading from top to bottom.
If no test expression is true, the block associated
with the <i>else</i> is evaluated.
Note that the <i>else</i> is not required; if no test expressions
evaluate to true, then no blocks are executed.
</p>
<p>What is the difference between <i>if-elseif-else</i>
chains and a sequence of
unchained <i>if</i>s? Consider this rewrite of the
above code:
</p>
<pre>
    if (bases == 4)
        {
        printf("HOME RUN!!!\n");
        }
    if (bases == 3)
        {
        printf("TrIpLe!!\n");
        }
    if (bases == 2)
        {
        printf("double!\n");
        }
    if (bases == 1) 
        {
        printf("single\n");
        }
    else
        {
        printf("out\n");
        }
</pre>
<p>In the second version, there are four <i>if</i> statements and
the <i>else</i> belongs to the last <i>if</i>. Does this behave exactly
the same? The answer is, it depends. Suppose the value
of the variable <i>bases</i> is 0. Then both versions print:
</p>
<pre>
    out
</pre>
<p>However, if the value of <i>bases</i> is 3, for example, the first
version prints:
</p>
<pre>
    TrIpLe!!
</pre>
<p>while the second version prints:
</p>
<pre>
    TrIpLe!!
    out
</pre>
<p>Why the difference? In the first version, a subsequent test
expression is evaluated <i>only</i> if all previous test expressions
evaluated to false. Once a test expression evaluates to true in
an <i>if-elseif-else</i> chain, the associated block is evaluated and
no more processing of the chain is performed. Like the <font size="-1"><b>AND</b></font> and
<font size="-1"><b>OR</b></font> B<font size="-1">OOLEAN</font>&#32;connectives,
an <i>if-elseif-else</i> chain short-circuits.
</p>
<p>In contrast, the sequences of <i>if</i>s in the rewrite 
are independent; there is no
short-circuiting. When the test expression of the first <i>if</i>
fails, the test expression of the second <i>if</i> succeeds
and <tt>TrIpLe!!</tt> is
printed. Now the test expression of the third <i>if</i> is tested and
fails as well as the test expression of the fourth <i>if</i>. But since
the fourth <i>if</i> has an else, the <i>else</i> block is evaluated and
<tt>out</tt>
is printed.
</p>
<p>It is important to know when to use an <i>if-elseif-else</i> chain and
when to use a sequence of independent <i>if</i>s.
If there should be only
one outcome, then use an <i>if-elseif-else</i> chain. Otherwise,
use a sequence of <i>if</i>s.

Other constructs in the same vein as the <i>if</i> statement are
<i>switch</i> or <i>case</i> statement and the embedded <i>if</i> expression
(sometimes known as the <i>ternary operator</i>).

<h2><a name="id7">Practice with B<font size="-1">OOLEAN</font>&#32;expressions</a></h2><p>
Here is some practice on writing complex B<font size="-1">OOLEAN</font>&#32;expressions.
Your task is to convert the English description into a C
B<font size="-1">OOLEAN</font>&#32;expression.
The variables to be used in the expressions are:
</p>
<ul><li><i>animal</i> with string values <code>"dog"</code> and <code>"cat"</code><br /></li><li><i>size</i> with string values <code>"small"</code>, <code>"medium"</code>, and <code>"large"</code><br /></li><li><i>hasSpots</i> with B<font size="-1">OOLEAN</font>&#32;values 1 or 0<br /></li><li><i>age</i> with positive integer values<br /></li><li><i>coatColor</i> with string values <code>"white"</code>, <code>"black"</code>, <code>"red"</code>, and <code>"brown"</code><br /></li><li><i>eyeColor</i> with string values <code>"green"</code>, <code>"brown"</code>, <code>"blue"</code><br /></li></ul>
<p>An old dog is one with an age greater than seven years while an old cat has
an age greater than or equal to nine years. A cat and a dog are young if
they are younger than three years old.
</p>
<p>Write a boolean expression that captures:
</p>
<p><i>Dogs that are large and have spots or cats that are white but do not
have blue eyes.</i>
</p>
<p>Highlight the following line to see the answer:
