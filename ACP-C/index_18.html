<h2><a name="id1">Structures</a></h2><p>
Arrays in C are limited in that they are homogeneous and
cannot grow as needed.
To tackle the homogeneity problem, we will use something called
a <i>structure</i>; a structure will allow us to collect
heterogeneous data together. To solve the expandability problem,
we will use structures to implement linked lists. We'll discuss
linked-lists in subsequent chapters; for now, we will focus
on the structures themselves.
</p>
<p>Just like we can collect literal values together in an array and
can collect actions together in a function, we can collect variables
together in something called a <i>structure</i>.
Suppose we wished to collect an integer, a string, and a double
variable together. To do so, we would define a structure like this:
</p>
<pre>
    struct stuff
        {
        int x;
        char *s;
        double r;
        };
</pre>
<p>A structure in C is introduced with the keyword <code>struct</code>, followed
by the name of the structure (in this case, <i>stuff</i>)
followed by a collection of variable
definitions enclosed in braces. Our <i>stuff</i> structure is composed of
three variables, <i>x</i>, <i>s</i>, and <i>r</i>.
</p>
<p>Like arrays, we can allocate a structure both statically and
dynamically. A static allocation looks like this:
</p>
<pre>
    struct node n;
</pre>
<p>To access the individual variables in a statically allocated structure,
we use the <i>dot</i> operator:
</p>
<pre>
    //test
    struct stuff { int x; char *s; double r; }; //define the struct
    struct stuff n;                             //allocate the struct
    n.x = 42;
    n.s = "hello, world!";
    n.r = 3.14159;
    printf("n.x is %d\n",n.x);
    printf("n.s is %s\n",n.s);
    printf("n.r is %f\n",n.r);
</pre>
<p>Running this code yields:
</p>
<pre>
    n.x is 42
    n.s is hello, world!
    n.r is 3.141590
</pre>
<p>Unlike statically allocated arrays, statically allocated structures
can be returned from functions under certain circumstances. Such manipulations
of structures can be inefficient, so we will focus on dynamically
allocated structures. Here is the dynamically allocated version of the 
above code fragment:
</p>
<pre>
    //test
    struct stuff { int x; char *s; double r; }; //define the struct
    struct stuff *n;                            //create the pointer
    n = malloc(sizeof(struct stuff));           //malloc failure test omitted
    n-&gt;x = 42;
    n-&gt;s = "hello, world!";
    n-&gt;r = 3.14159;
    printf("n-&gt;x is %d\n",n-&gt;x);
    printf("n-&gt;s is %s\n",n-&gt;s);
    printf("n-&gt;r is %f\n",n-&gt;r);
</pre>
<p>Note that the "dot" operator is replace by the "arrow" operator;
the arrow is composed of a hyphen followed by a greater-than symbol.
</p>

<h2><a name="id2">Records as structures</a></h2><p>
Recall,
from the <a href="index_17.html">previous chapter</a>,
the concept of a record as a collection of related data.
A structure, because of its ability to bundle heterogeneous
data together, makes an ideal repository for the data comprising
a record. When we used an array to store a record, we needed
to keep each field of the record as a string, even when some
fields were clearly numbers. With structures, we are freed from
that constraint.
</p>
<p>Suppose, as before, our record is composed of name, title,
years of service, and salary:
</p>
<pre>
    "Amber Smith"       President   32   97000.05
    "Thad Jones"        Assistant   15   89000.42
    "Ellen Thompson"    Hacker       2  147000.99
</pre>
<p>A structure to reflect such a record could be defined as:
</p>
<pre>
    struct employee
        {
        char *name;
        char *title;
        int years;
        double salary;
        };
</pre>
<p>Since typing <code>struct employee</code> is such an onerous task, many Computer
Scientists will use the <i>typedef</i> mechanism to make an alias:
</p>
<pre>
    typedef struct employee
        {
        char *name;
        char *title;
        int years;
        double salary;
        } Employee;
</pre>
<p>Given this <i>typedef</i>, we can now use the terms <code>struct employee</code>
and <i>Employee</i>
interchangeably:
</p>
<pre>
    struct employee *e = malloc(sizeof(struct employee));
    Employee *e = malloc(sizeof(Employee));
</pre>
<p>These dynamic allocations are equivalent. Once you have an employee record,
it is extremely useful to define a function for displaying said record:
</p>
<pre>
    void
    displayEmployee(Employee *e)
        {
        printf("Employee: %s\n",e-&gt;name);
        printf("    Title: %s\n",e-&gt;title);
        printf("    Years of Service: %d\n",e-&gt;years);
        printf("    Salary: $%.2f\n",e-&gt;salary);
        }
</pre>
<p>Given the <i>Employee</i> structure
definition, a (renamed) version of the  <i>readRecord</i> function from the
<a href="index_17.html">previous chapter</a>,
becomes:
</p>
<pre>
    Employee *
    readEmployeeRecord(FILE *fp)         // we pass the file pointer in
        {
        char *name;
        
        name = readString(fp);           //name is a string, not a token

        if (feof(fp)) { return 0; }      // no record, return null

        //make an empty record

        Employee *e = malloc(sizeof(Employee)); //malloc failure test omitted

        e-&gt;name = name;
        e-&gt;title = readToken(fp);
        e-&gt;years = readInt(fp);
        e-&gt;salary = readReal(fp);

        return e;
        }
</pre>
<p>To test our <i>readEmployeeRecord</i> function, we will successively read employee
records from a file and print out the individual variable values
for each record:
</p>
<pre>
    void
    displayEmployeesInFile(FILE *fp)
        {
        Employee *e;

        e = readEmployeeRecord(fp);
        while (!feof(fp))
            {
            displayEmployee(e);
            e = readEmployeeRecord(fp);
            }

        fclose(fp);
        }
</pre>
<p>We use the standard reading pattern: read the first item
before the loop - test if the read was successful -
process the item read - read again at the bottom of the loop.
In this case, processing the item means displaying the record.
</p>
<p>Assuming the employee data can be found in the file <i>employees.dat</i>,
we can implement our main:
</p>
<pre>
    //test (compile with employee.c and scanner.c)
    #include "scanner.h"
    #include "employee.h"
    FILE *fp;
    if ((fp = fopen("employees.dat","r")) == 0)
        fprintf(stderr,"employees.dat could not be opened for reading\n");
    else
        displayEmployeesInFile(fp);
    fclose(fp);
</pre>

<h2><a name="id3">Constructors, accessors, and mutators</a></h2><p>
You may have heard of the term <i>object-oriented</i> when it comes to
programming languages. Object-oriented languages were created because
organizing code along object lines can be a very good way to write programs.
While the C language is not object-oriented, we can write our code in
much the same way.
</p>
<p>The fundamental unit in an object-oriented language is the <i>class</i>, which
is roughly equivalent to structures in C. Given a class, <i>objects</i> are
created using something called the <i>new</i> operator, which causes a new
object to come into being. We will simulate the <code>new</code> operator by
defining a function to dynamically allocate a structure and return it:
</p>
<pre>
    Employee *
    newEmptyEmployee(void)
        {
        Employee *p = malloc(sizeof(Employee)); //malloc failure test omitted
        p-&gt;name = "";                           //set to the empty string
        p-&gt;title = "";                          //set to the empty string
        p-&gt;years = 0;                           //set to zero
        p-&gt;salary = 0.0;                        //set to zero
        return p;
        }
</pre>
<p>A good implementation initializes the variables within the structure.
Given <i>p</i>, the
pointer to the structure, recall that we access the individual variables in the
structure by using the arrow operator, which is a hyphen followed by
a greater-than symbol. We initialize all the variables stored in
the structure to "empty" values.
</p>
<p>A function such as <i>newEmptyEmployee</i> is
known as a
<i>constructor</i>,
as it specifies how a structure should be constructed and initialized.
We can make an alternate constructor whereby we pass in all the values
stored in the structure:
</p>
<pre>
    Employee *
    newEmployee(char *n,char *t,int y,double s)
        {
        Employee *p = malloc(sizeof(Employee)); //malloc failure test omitted
        p-&gt;name = n;
        p-&gt;title = t;
        p-&gt;years = y;
        p-&gt;salary = s;
        return p;
        }
</pre>
<p>Object-orientation also introduces the terms <i>accessors</i> and <i>mutators</i>.
An accessor (sometimes the term <i>getter</i> is used) retrieves a component 
of an object or, in our case, the value of a variable inside the structure.
Since we have four variables in our <i>Employee</i> structure,
we will have four accessors:
</p>
<pre>
    char *getEmployeeName(Employee *e) { return e-&gt;name; }
    char *getEmployeeTitle(Employee *e) { return e-&gt;title; }
    int getEmployeeYears(Employee *e) { return e-&gt;years; }
    double getEmployeeSalary(Employee *e) { return e-&gt;salary; }
</pre>
<p>A mutator (sometimes <i>setter</i>) replaces a component in an object:
</p>
<pre>
    void setEmployeeName(Employee *e,char *n) { e-&gt;name = n; }
    void setEmployeeTitle(Employee *e,char *t) { e-&gt;title = t; }
    void setEmployeeYears(Employee *e,int y) { e-&gt;years = y; }
    void setEmployeeSalary(Employee *e,double s) { e-&gt;salary = s; }
</pre>
<p>A convention we will follow is that the structure will always be
the first argument to a function that manipulates the structure.
</p>
<p>Given these definitions, we can rewrite <i>readEmployeeRecord</i>:
</p>
<pre>
    Employee *
    readEmployeeRecord(FILE *fp)         // we pass the file pointer in
        {
        char *name,*title;
        int years;
        double salary;
        
        name = readString(fp);           //name is a string, not a token

        if (feof(fp)) { return 0; }      // no record, return the null pointer

        name = name;
        title = readToken(fp);
        years = readInt(fp);
        salary = readReal(fp);

        return newEmployee(name,title,years,salary);
        }
</pre>
<p>We can also rewrite <i>displayEmployee</i> to use accessors:
</p>
<pre>
    void
    displayEmployee(Employee *e)
        {
        printf("Employee: %s\n",getEmployeeName(e));
        printf("    Title: %s\n",getEmployeeTitle(e));
        printf("    Years of Service: %d\n",getEmployeeYears(e));
        printf("    Salary: $%.2f\n",getEmployeeSalary(e));
        }
</pre>
<p>Note how <i>readEmployeeRecord</i> and <i>displayEmployee</i>
now give no clues
as to how an employee record is stored. Indeed, with an alternate definition of
the typedef <i>Employee</i>, with new versions of constructors and accessors,
we could store an employee records as an array of four strings (as in
the previous chapter) and both <i>readEmployeeRecord</i> as well as
<i>displayEmployee</i>
would still
work as before, <i>without any changes</i>.
</p>
<p>This idea of abstracting the internal details of how data is stored
is a powerful tool in writing code that is easy to understand, modify,
and maintain.
</p>

<h2><a name="id4">Storing collections of records</a></h2><p>
We have omitted from our discussions how we might store 
a collection of records.
One possibility is to store them in an array.
</p>

<h3><a name="id5">Storing records in a dynamic array</a></h3><p>
The code for storing records in a dynamic array will be almost identical
to the <i>readTable</i> function shown in the previous chapter.
Recall, that we will need
to return two values from the function that performs this task, the
number of records found and the array that stores them:
</p>
<pre>
    Employee **
    readAllEmployeeRecords(FILE *fp,int *finalSize)
        {
        int count;
        int size = 10;                //initial size of destination array
        Employee *record;
        Employee **table;

        //allocate the destination array
        table = allocate(sizeof(Employee *) * size);

        count = 0;
        record = readEmployeeRecord(fp);
        while (!feof(fp))
            {
            if (count == size)              //array is full!
                {
                // grow the array by doubling its size
                size = size * 2;
                table = reallocate(table,sizeof(Employee *) * size);
                //now there is enough room
                }
            table[count] = record;           //DO NOT FREE THE RECORD!
            ++count;
            record = readEmployeeRecord(fp);
            }
        fclose(fp);

        //shrink the array to 'count' number of elements
        table = reallocate(table,sizeof(Employee *) * count);

        //count holds the number of items, store it in *finalSize
        *finalSize = count;
        return table;
        }
</pre>
<p>A call to this function might look like:
</p>
<pre>
    int size;
    Employee **table = readAllEmployeeRecords(fp,&amp;size);
</pre>
<p>At this point, <i>table</i> points to an array of Employee record pointers
and <i>size</i> holds the final size of that array.
</p>
<p>One can see by comparing <i>readTable</i> from the previous chapter and
<i>readAllEmployeeRecords</i> in this chapter, we see that the only 
changes are the return value,
the type array of records (the table), the
type of the individual record, and the name of the function
to read a record.  This is why the pattern approach to
programming is so powerful. Once you understand the pattern, it
is relatively simple to implement it for a variety of types.
</p>

<h2><a name="id6">Another way to store records</a></h2><p>
There is another way to store a collection of records: using
a <i>linked list</i>.
We investigate linked lists in the next chapter.
