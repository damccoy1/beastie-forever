<h1>Input and Output</h1>
<p>Generally all computational entities, be it variables, functions, or programs,
require some sort of input and output. Input roughly corresponds
to the process of supplying
data and output roughly corresponds to the process of retrieving data.
For a variable, assignment
is the way values (data) are supplied to the variable, while
referencing the
variable (as part of an expression)
is the way that data is retrieved.
For functions, the input is the set of arguments that are supplied
in a function call, while the output of a function is its return value.
For programs, input refers to pulling in data
and output refers to pushing out results.
In this chapter, we focus on managing the input and output of programs.
</p>

<h2><a name="id1">Input</a></h2><p>
Input is the process of obtaining data that a program needs
to perform its task. There are generally three ways for
a program to obtain data:
</p>
<ul><li>interactively, by querying the user for information
</li><li>via the command line, by accessing an array of command line arguments
</li><li>via a file, by opening a file and reading its contents
</li></ul>
<p>We examine these three approaches in turn.
</p>

<h3><a name="id2">Reading from the keyboard</a></h3><p>
To read from the keyboard, one uses the <i>scanf</i> function.
</p>

<h4><a name="id3">Reading integers</a></h4><p>
To read an integer, an integer directive is supplied to <i>scanf</i>:
</p>
<pre>
    //test
    int num;
    printf("Please enter an integer: ");
    scanf("%d",&amp;num);
    printf("the number you entered was %d\n",num);
</pre>
<p>The <i>scanf</i> function
takes a guide string and a pointer to a memory location,
Moreover, <i>scanf</i> returns when it has seen an integer followed
by a newline on the input. At a level lower than <i>scanf</i>, C waits until
an entire line has been input before <i>scanf</i> can start its task.
</p>
<p>In the example, we give the address of <i>num</i>; the <code>&amp;</code> operator returns the
address of the <i>num</i> variable.
We have seen pointers to arrays. Pointers
to variables are really the same thing. The difference is a pointer to
a single variable can be thought of as an array with a single slot.
Let's rewrite the above example a little bit:
</p>
<pre>
    //test
    int num;
    int *addr;              //an 'array' pointer
    addr = &amp;num;            //&amp;num has type 'int *'
    printf("Please enter an integer: ");
    scanf("%d",addr);
    printf("num is %d\n",num);
    printf("addr[0] is %d\n",addr[0]);
    printf("*addr is %d\n",*addr);
</pre>
<p>Suppose <i>num</i> is placed at memory location 1004.
Immediately prior to the first <i>printf</i>, the situation looks like:
</p>
<div align="center">
<img scale=0.50 alt="" src="pic-io1.png"/>
</div>
<p>The <i>addr</i> variable, as desired, holds the address of <i>num</i>.
Now the value of <i>addr</i> is passed as the second argument to <i>scanf</i>.
The <i>scanf</i> function
reads in a number and places it in the memory location specified
by the second argument. In this case, it is placed at memory location
1004. So, if the user enters the number 42, then 42 is stored as
the value of <i>num</i>:
</p>
<div align="center">
<img scale=0.50 alt="" src="pic-io2.png"/>
</div>
<p>The final three print statements all output the value 42. The first
does so since the value read in by <i>scanf</i> was stored in <i>num</i>.
The second does so since <i>addr</i> can be considered a
pointer to an array of length 1:
</p>
<div align="center">
<img scale=0.50 alt="" src="pic-io3.png"/>
</div>
<p>The final print statement prints 42 since <code>*addr</code>
is an alternate form of <code>addr[0]</code>.
When we take the address of a variable, we will rarely use the array
indexing form used by the second print statement,
preferring instead the <i>pointer dereferencing</i>
form of the third print statement.
</p>

<h4><a name="id4">Reading real numbers</a></h4><p>
Reading a real number is similar to reading an integer, except the
<code>"%lf"</code> directive and the address of a double variable
is passed to <i>scanf</i>:
</p>
<pre>
    //test
    double realNumber;
    printf("Please enter a real number: ");
    scanf("%lf",&amp;realNumber);
    printf("the number you entered was %f\n",realNumber);
</pre>

<h4><a name="id5">Reading single characters</a></h4><p>
For a character, the <code>"%c"</code> directive and the
address of a character variable is passed to <i>scanf</i>.
</p>
<pre>
    //test
    char ch;
    printf("Please enter a character: ");
    scanf("%c",&amp;ch);
    printf("the character you entered was &lt;%c&gt;\n",ch);
</pre>
<p>With the <code>"%c"</code> directive, the next character on the input stream
is read, regardless of whether or not it is a whitespace. If one places
a space before the percent sign in the directive, then <i>scanf</i> will
skip over any whitespace and read the first non-whitespace character
pending on the input:
</p>
<pre>
    //test
    char ch;
    printf("Please enter some whitespace, then a character: ");
    scanf(" %c",&amp;ch); //note the space in the directive
    printf("the first darkspace character you entered was &lt;%c&gt;\n",ch);
</pre>

<h4><a name="id6">Reading strings</a></h4><p>
One can use the <i>scanf</i> function to read multiple characters
at a time from the keyboard with
the <code>"%s"</code> directive:
</p>
<pre>
    //test of VERY DANGEROUS CODE
    char buffer[512]; //room for 511 chars plus the null char
    printf("Please enter a token: ");
    scanf("%s",buffer);
    printf("the token you entered was &lt;%s&gt;\n",buffer);
</pre>
<p>where a <code>token</code> is a contiguous sequence of non-whitespace characters.
Why is this code dangerous? The reason is <i>scanf</i> does not ensure that
no more than 511 characters (in this example) are read into array <i>buffer</i>.
So if the token entered is, say, 600 characters in length,
an additional 90 characters will be read into memory, trashing the
memory beyond the extent of the array.
</p>
<p>A very clever and devious person at some point realized that if the token was
long enough, the memory trashing
would extend beyond the memory space reserved for the local variables
and into the region of memory that stores the location of the caller
of the current function.
When the current function returns, program control jumps to the caller
of the function.
By carefully choosing the additional characters,
the return location is overwritten with the address of
the buffer itself. If the buffer is filled with characters that
look like machine code, then this new program would run with
the same privileges as the original program.
If
a program with high privileges is exploited in this way, then
the exploiter could potentially
take over the system.
</p>
<p>This is not just a theoretical problem. The first widespread internet
virus, the Morris worm, used this approach and brought large portions 
of the internet to a halt<sup><a href="index_26.html#footnote-26">26</a></sup>.
</p>
<p>In fact, many of the vulnerabilities being discovered or exploited today
are due to this use of <i>scanf</i> and related functions in system-level C code.
So, NEVER USE SCANF TO READ IN A STRING!
Instead of <i>scanf</i><sup><a href="index_26.html#footnote-27">27</a></sup>,
one should read a line one character at
a time and checking to see if too many characters are encountered
before the newline is seen. This is a rather onerous task, so it
has been done for you. To get this code, download the following
files:
</p>
<pre>
    wget troll.cs.ua.edu/ACP-C/scanner.c
    wget troll.cs.ua.edu/ACP-C/scanner.h
</pre>
<p>The <i>scanner.c</i> file contains the definitions of the following functions:
</p>
<div align="center">
<p><table><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" align="left">
<i>function</i>          </td><td colspan="1" align="left"> <i>purpose</i></td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="1" align="left">
<i>readInt</i>     </td><td colspan="1" align="left"> returns the next integer</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="1" align="left">
<i>readReal</i>    </td><td colspan="1" align="left"> returns the next double</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="1" align="left">
<i>readChar</i>    </td><td colspan="1" align="left"> returns the next darkspace character</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="1" align="left">
<i>readRawChar</i> </td><td colspan="1" align="left"> returns the next character, whitespace or darkspace</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="1" align="left">
<i>readToken</i>   </td><td colspan="1" align="left"> returns the next token</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="1" align="left">
<i>readString</i>  </td><td colspan="1" align="left"> returns the next double quoted string</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="1" align="left">
<i>readLine</i>    </td><td colspan="1" align="left"> returns the remainder of current line</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="1" align="left">
</td></tr></tbody></table>
</p>
</div>
<p>You can read more about these functions in the documentation
of <i>scanner.c</i>. You can find the prototypes of the functions
in <i>scanner.h</i>.
</p>
<p>The <i>scanf</i> code for reading a token can be replaced with a
safe call to <i>readToken</i>. To use the scanner, you need to
add the following line after the system includes:
</p>
<pre>
    #include "scanner.h"
</pre>
<p>Then you can make calls to the scanner functions:
</p>
<pre>
    //test
    char *s;  //note change of s to a char pointer
    printf("Please enter a token: ");
    s = readToken(stdin);     //stdin is the keyboard
    printf("the token you entered was &lt;%s&gt;\n",s);
    free(s); //s points to a malloc'd array so free it when done
</pre>
<p>To compile code that calls scanner functions, you will need to
compile <i>scanner.c</i> with the rest of your
program. Suppose your <i>main</i> function is in
<i>tester.c</i> and it calls <i>readToken</i>. To compile the program, you 
would enter the command:
</p>
<pre>
    gcc -Wall -g -o tester tester.c scanner.c
</pre>
<p>The scanner functions require the passing in of a file pointer. This
allows them to read from the keyboard (using <i>stdin</i>) or from a file (more
on that later on in the chapter). The first four functions listed
are wrappers to <i>scanf</i>. The last three read characters into
a statically allocated array.
If there is not enough room, an error message
is printed and the program is terminated. If there is room,
the array is copied into malloc'd memory and a pointer this
memory is returned.
</p>

<h4><a name="id7">Reading directly into arrays</a></h4><p>
One can read directly into arrays by using pointer offsets:
</p>
<pre>
    //test
    int a[3];
    printf("give me the first number: ");
    scanf("%d",a+0);
    printf("give me the second number: ");
    scanf("%d",a+1);
    printf("give me the third number: ");
    scanf("%d",a+2);

    printf("[%d]",a[0]);
    printf("[%d]",a[1]);
    printf("[%d]",a[2]);
    printf("\n");
</pre>
<p>If the three numbers read were 2, 13, and 42, in that order,
then the output would be:
</p>
<pre>
    [2][13][42]
</pre>
<p>Sometimes you will see:
</p>
<pre>
    scanf("%d",&amp;a[1]);
</pre>
<p>instead of:
</p>
<pre>
    scanf("%d",a+1);
</pre>
<p>The former is usually written by a programmer who is a little unsure
of the relationships between statically allocated arrays and pointers.
One can also use the scanner functions:
</p>
<pre>
    ...
    printf("give me the first number: ");
    a[0] = readInt(stdin);
    printf("give me the second number: ");
    a[1] = readInt(stdin);
    printf("give me the third number: ");
    a[2] = readInt(stdin);
    ...
</pre>

<h3><a name="id8">Reading from the command line</a></h3><p>
The second way to pass information to a program is
through <i>command-line arguments</i>.
The command line is the line typed in a terminal window
that runs a C program (or any other program).
Here is a typical command line on a Linux system:
</p>
<pre>
    lusth@warka:~/l1/activities$ prog3
</pre>
<p>Everything up to and including the dollar sign is
the system prompt. As with all prompts, it is used
to signify that the system is waiting for input.
The user of the system (me) has typed in the command:
</p>
<pre>
    prog3
</pre>
<p>in response to the prompt. Suppose <i>prog3.c</i> is a file
with the following code:
</p>
<pre>
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
    #include &lt;math.h&gt;
    #include &lt;string.h&gt;

    int
    main(int argc,char **argv)
        {
        int i;
        printf("Number of command-line arguments: %d\n",argc);
        printf("Command-line arguments:\n");
        i = 0;
        while (i &lt; argc)
            {
            printf("    %s\n",argv[i]);
            ++i;
            }
        return 0;
        }
</pre>
<p>We haven't covered loops yet, but all the program does is print out
all of the command line arguments. 
In this case, the output of this program would be:
</p>
<pre>

    lusth@warka:~/l1/activities$ gcc -Wall -g -o prog3 prog3.c
    lusth@warka:~/l1/activities$ prog3
    Number of command-line arguments: 1
    Command-line arguments:
        prog3
</pre>
<p>From the output, we can see that there was one command-line argument,
the name of the executable. Looking more closely at the code:
</p>
<pre>
    printf("Number of command-line arguments: %d\n",argc);
</pre>
<p>we see that the number of command line arguments is stored in the formal
parameter <i>argc</i>. We see also:
</p>
<pre>
    printf("    %s\n",argv[i]);
</pre>
<p>that the command line arguments themselves are stored in the formal
parameter <i>argv</i>.
This tells us that <i>argv</i> points to an array of strings.
A pointer has a star, and a string has a *, hence the typing of
<i>argv</i>:
</p>
<pre>
    char **argv;
</pre>
<p>with two stars.
</p>
<p>Any whitespace-delimited tokens following
the program file name are stored in <i>argv</i> 
along with the name of the program being run.
For example, suppose we run <i>prog3</i> with the this
command:
</p>
<pre>
    lusth@warka:~/l1/activities$ prog3.py 123 123.4 True hello, world
</pre>
<p>Then the output would be:
</p>
<pre>
    Number of command-line arguments: 6
    Command-line arguments:
        prog3
        123
        123.4
        True
        hello,
        world
</pre>
<p>From this result, we can see that all of the tokens are stored
in <i>argv</i> and that they are stored as strings, <i>regardless</i> of
whether they look like some other entity, such as integer or
real number.
</p>
<p>If we wish for <code>"hello, world"</code> to be a single token,
we would need to enclose the tokens in quotes:
</p>
<pre>
    prog3 123 123.4 True "hello, world"
</pre>
<p>In this case, the output is:
</p>
<pre>
Number of command-line arguments: 5
Command-line arguments:
    prog3
    123
    123.4
    True
    hello, world
</pre>
<p>There are certain characters that have special meaning to
the system. A couple of these are '*' and ';'. To include
these characters in a command-line argument, they need to
be <i>escaped</i> by inserting a backslash prior to the 
character.
Here is an example:
</p>
<pre>
    prog3 \; \* \\
</pre>
<p>To insert a backslash, one escapes it with a backslash.
The output from this command is:
</p>
<pre>
    Number of command-line arguments: 4
    Command-line arguments:
        prog3
        ;
        *
        \
</pre>
<p>Although it looks as if there are two backslashes in the last
token, there is but a single backslash. Most Linux programs,
including the terminal window shell, uses two
backslashes to indicate a single backslash.
</p>

<h4><a name="id9">What command-line arguments are</a></h4><p>
The command line arguments  are stored as strings.
Therefore, you must use <i>atoi</i> or <i>atof</i>
if you
wish to use any of the command line arguments as integers or
real numbers, respectively.
Here is code that tests that there are two command-line arguments
beyond the program name, the first representing an integer and the second 
representing a real:
</p>
<pre>
    //test
    int x;
    double y;
    if (argc != 3)
       {
       fprintf(stderr,"there should be two args beyond the program name\n");
       exit(1);
       }
    x = atoi(argv[1]);
    y = atof(argv[2]);

    printf("1st additional arg is %d\n",x);
    printf("2nd additional arg is %f\n",y);
</pre>
<p>Given the additional arguments 23 and 4.5, the output should be:
</p>
<pre>
    1st additional arg is 23
    2nd additional arg is 4.500000
</pre>

<h3><a name="id10">Reading from files</a></h3><p>
The third way to get data to a program is to read the
data that has been previously stored in a file.
</p>
<p>C uses a <i>file pointer</i> system in reading from a
file. To read from a file, the first
step is to obtain a pointer to the file. This is
known as <i>opening</i> a file. The file pointer
will always point to the first unread character in
a file.
When a file is first opened, the file pointer points to
the first character in the file.
</p>

<h4><a name="id11">Reading files using <i>fscanf</i></a></h4><p>
Suppose
we wish to read from a file named <i>data</i>. We
first obtain a file pointer by opening the file like this:
</p>
<pre>
    FILE *fp = fopen("data","r")
    if (fp == 0)
        {
        fprintf(stderr,"file data could not be opened for reading\n");
        exit(1);
        }
</pre>
<p>The <i>fopen</i> function takes two arguments, the name of the
file and the kind of file pointer to return. We store the file
pointer in a variable named <i>fp</i> (a variable name commonly used
to hold a file pointer). In this
case, we wish for a <i>reading</i> file pointer, so we pass
the string <code>"r"</code>. We can also open a file for writing;
more on that in the next section.
In any case, you should always test the return value of <i>fopen</i>;
a return value of zero means a problem has occurred.
</p>
<p>Once we have the file pointer, we can use <i>fscanf</i> to read various
kinds of items. For example, to read an integer, we would
use the <code>"%d"</code> directive:
</p>
<pre>
   //test
   int x;
   FILE *fp = fopen("data","r");
   //test of fp omitted
   fscanf(fp,"%d",&amp;x);
   printf("the number read was %d\n",x);
   fclose(fp);
</pre>
<p>Note how similar the call to <i>fscanf</i> is to <i>scanf</i>.
The following two calls are equivalent:
</p>
<pre>
    scanf("%d",&amp;x);
    fscanf(stdin,"%d",&amp;x);
</pre>
<p>In fact, <i>scanf</i> and <i>fscanf</i>
are identical except that <i>scanf</i> hard-wires
the file pointer to <i>stdin</i>, the keyboard.
</p>
<p>When we are done reading a file, we <i>close</i> it:
</p>
<pre>
    fclose(fp);
</pre>
<p>Always remember to close your files!
</p>

<h4><a name="id12">Reading files using the scanner</a></h4><p>
We can also use the scanner functions to read from a file,
by passing a file pointer
instead of <i>stdin</i>:
</p>
<pre>
   //test
   int x;
   FILE *fp = fopen("data","r");
   //test of fp omitted
   x = readInt(fp);
   printf("the number read was %d\n",x);
   fclose(fp);
</pre>
<p>As always, remember to close your files when finished.
</p>

<h2><a name="id13">Output</a></h2><p>
Once a program has processed its input, it needs to make its output
known, either by displaying results to the user or by storing the
results in a file.
</p>

<h3><a name="id14">Writing to the console</a></h3><p>
We have been writing to the console using <i>printf</i> for some time now.
The <i>printf</i> function is <i>variadic</i>, which means
it can take a variable number
of arguments:
</p>
<pre>
    //test
    int x = 3;
    double y = 14.4;
    char *z = "hello";
    printf("an integer, %d, a real number, %f, and a string, %s\n",x,y,z);
</pre>
<p>The arguments after the guide string are match to the directives
in the guide string, in order given.
If you have a mismatch between the directive and the corresponding
argument, you will get a warning message when you compile.
</p>

<h2><a name="id15">Printing quote characters</a></h2><p>
Suppose I have the string:
</p>
<pre>
    char *str = "Hello";
</pre>
<p>If I print my string:
</p>
<pre>
    printf("%s",str);
</pre>
<p>The output looks like this:
</p>
<pre>
    Hello
</pre>
<p>Notice the double quotes are not printed. But suppose I wish to print
quotes around my string, so that the output looks like:
</p>
<pre>
    "Hello"
</pre>
<p>To do this, the print statement becomes:
</p>
<pre>
   printf("\"%s\"",str);
</pre>
<p>If I want the double quotes to be in the string itself, str would
assigned thusly:
</p>
<pre>
    str = "\"Hello\"";
</pre>
<p>If you need a refresher on what the string <code>"\""</code> means, please see
<a href="index_10.html">the chapter on strings</a>.
</p>

<h2><a name="id16">Writing to a file</a></h2><p>
C also requires a file pointer to write to 
a file. The <i>fopen</i> function is again used to obtain
a file pointer, but this time we desire a <i>writing</i>
file pointer, so we send the string <code>"w"</code> as the
second argument to <i>fopen</i>:
</p>
<pre>
    FILE *fp = fopen("data.save","w")
</pre>
<p>Now the variable <i>fp</i> points to a writing file object;
we write to the file using <i>fprintf</i>. The correspondence between
<i>fprintf</i> and <i>printf</i> is the same as
that between <i>fscanf</i> and
<i>scanf</i>. The following two calls are equivalent:
</p>
<pre>
    printf("hello, world!\n");
    fprintf(stdout,"hello, world!\n");
</pre>
<p>The <i>printf</i> function simply hardwires the file pointer to <i>stdout</i>,
which represents the console.
As with reading, a file opened for writing should be checked for
a successful open and should be closed with <i>fclose</i> when reading
is complete.
</p>
<p>Opening a file in order to write
it has the effect of emptying the file of its contents
soon as it is opened.
The following code deletes
the <i>contents</i> of a file (which is different than
deleting the file):
</p>
<pre>
    // delete the contents
    FILE *fp = fopen(fileName,"w")
    //check that fopen did not encounter a problem
    fclose(fp);
</pre>
<p>If you wish to start writing to a file, but save what was
there previously, call the <i>open</i> function to obtain
an <i>appending</i> file pointer:
</p>
<pre>
    FILE *fp = fopen(fileName,"a")
</pre>
<p>Subsequent writes to <i>fp</i> will append text to what is already there.
