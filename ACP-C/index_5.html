<h1>Literals</h1>
<p>C works by figuring out the meaning or value of some code.
This is true for the tiniest pieces of code to the largest
programs. The process of finding out the meaning of code
is known as <i>evaluation</i>.
</p>
<p>The things whose values are the things themselves are known as
<i>literals</i>. The literals of C can be categorized by the following
types:
<i>integers</i>, <i>real</i> <i>numbers</i>, <i>characters</i>, and
<i>strings</i>.
</p>

<h2><a name="id1">Integers</a></h2><p>
Integers are numbers without any fractional parts.
Examples of integers are:
</p>
<pre>
    3
    -5
    0
</pre>
<p>Integers must begin with a digit or a minus sign. The initial minus sign
must immediately be followed by a digit.
</p>
<p>The integer type in C is <code>int</code>. There are other integer types that
we will not get to in this book. You can find them by searching the
interwebs for "C integral types".
</p>
<p>It is important to realize that there are limits to what can be stored in an integer.
As mentioned above, C has several different types of integers that are designed
for specific situations.  For example, if a developer only ever store values in the range of
0 to 100 then that person could use a smaller version of an integer that saves space.
In this class, you should always use the default <code>int</code> class unless you are told
otherwise.
</p>
<p>It is recommended that you search the interwebs to determine the maximum (and
minimum) value that you can store in an integer in C.
</p>

<h2><a name="id2">Real Numbers</a></h2><p>
Reals are numbers that do have a fractional part (even if that fractional
part is zero!). Examples of real numbers are:
</p>
<pre>
    3.2
    4.000
    5.
    0.3
    .3
    3.2e-4
    3e4
    .000000987654321
</pre>
<p>Real numbers must start with a digit or a minus sign or a decimal
point. An initial minus sign must immediately be followed by a digit or a
decimal point. An initial decimal point must immediately be followed by
a digit. C accepts real numbers in scientific notation. For example,
<i>3.3 * 10<sup>-11</sup></i> would be entered as 3.3e-11. The "e" stands for exponent and
the 10 is understood, so <code>e-11</code> means multiply whatever precedes the
<code>e</code> by <i>10<sup>-11</sup></i>.
</p>
<p>The real number type in C is <code>double</code>. This is short for
<i>double precision floating point number</i>. There is another real
number type called <i>float</i>, which is short for
<i>single precision floating point number</i>, but it is not used very much.
</p>
<p>As with integers, there are limits to how bit (and small) a number can be
stored in a <i>double</i>.  It is recommended that you do another interwebs search
to learn the limits on real numbers.  You might find it useful to compare
the limits of a <i>double</i> and a <i>float</i> as that will help you understand
why most programmers simply use <i>double</i>.
</p>

<h2><a name="LiteralsCharacters">Characters</a></h2>
<p>In C, characters
generally are single letters, digits, or symbols
delineated by single quotes:
</p>
<pre>
    'a'
    'Z'
    '&amp;'
    '9'
    ' '
</pre>
<p>The last character in the above list is the space character. There are
also a number of two-character characters, some of which are:
</p>
<pre>
    '\n'
    '\t'
    '\0'
    '\''
    '\\'
</pre>
<p>The first symbol in these two-character characters
is the <i>backslash</i>; symbols preceded by
a backslash are said to have been
<i>escaped</i>.
Escaping a symbol will often
change its meaning.
For example, the character
<i>n</i>, in a string refers to the letter <i>n</i> while the character sequence
<code>\n</code>
refers
to the <i>newline</i> character. A backslash also changes the meaning of the
letter <i>t</i>,
converting it into a tab character.
An escaped zero is the null character which used to terminate strings.
To specify the single quote character or a backslash,
one needs to escape them with a backslash, otherwise the C compiler
will get confused. Are you
confused?
Don't worry. It'll become natural after a while.
</p>
<p>The character type in C is <code>char</code>. There is a great debate
on how to properly pronounce "char'.
Three groups have emerged, those who know how to pronounce "char" properly (these
folks say "care" as in "careful") and those who don't (these folks say "char" as
in "char" as in "charcoal"). The third group takes a more Southern
approach to the pronunciation, (these folks say "car" as in "cartoon").
Who knows who is right?
</p>
<p>A character is one byte (8 bits).  If you want to see how the various
characters (<code>'a'</code>, <code>'$'</code>, <code>'Z'</code>, <i>etc.</i>) are stored, do a search on the
interwebs for ASCII tables.
</p>

<h2><a name="LiteralsStrings">Strings</a></h2>
<p>Strings are sequences of characters delineated by double quotation marks:
</p>
<pre>
    "hello, world!"
    "x\nx"
    "\"z\""
    ""
</pre>
<p>Like characters, the symbols
in a string can be <i>escaped</i>
with the backslash character,
You can also escape double quotes with backslashes
so that you can include them in a string.
A string with no characters
between the double quotes is known as an empty string.
</p>
<p>The string type in C is <code>char *</code>, pronounced "char-star".
This is because strings are actually arrays of characters and,
as you will learn later, an asterisk can be used to indicate
an array. So <code>char *</code> can be read as "array of <code>char</code>".
We will
delve into arrays in a later chapter.
</p>

<h2><a name="id5">B<font size="-1">OOLEAN</font>s</a></h2><p>
Many languages have an additional kind of literal that C
does not have, the B<font size="-1">OOLEAN</font>&#32;literals
<code>True</code> and <code>False</code>.
B<font size="-1">OOLEAN</font>s are used to 
guide the flow of a program.
The term B<font size="-1">OOLEAN</font>&#32;is derived from the last name of George Boole, who,
in his 1854 paper <i>An Investigation of the Laws of Thought, on which are
founded the Mathematical Theories of Logic and Probabilities</i>, laid one
of the cornerstones of the modern digital computer. The so-called B<font size="-1">OOLEAN</font>&#10;logic or B<font size="-1">OOLEAN</font>&#32;algebra is concerned with the rules of combining truth
values (i.e., true or false). As we will see, knowledge of such rules will
be important for making C programs behave properly. In particular,
B<font size="-1">OOLEAN</font>&#32;expressions will be used to control conditionals and loops.
</p>
<p>Even though C has no explicit B<font size="-1">OOLEAN</font>s, the integers serve double-duty,
both as numbers and as B<font size="-1">OOLEAN</font>&#32;literals.
In C, the integer zero serves as <code>False</code>
and any other integer or integer-like
value serves as <code>True</code>. Novices sometimes make the mistake that
only the number 1 is <i>True</i>.
It is <code>True</code>, but it is not the only <code>True</code>. For example,
2384, -12, and
42 are also <code>True</code>.
