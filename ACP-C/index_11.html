<h1>Functions</h1>
<p>Recall from 
<a href="index_8.html">the chapter on assignment</a>
the series of expressions we evaluated to find
the <i>y</i>-value of a point on the line:
</p>
<pre>
    y = 5x - 3
</pre>
<p>First, we assigned values to the slope,
the <i>x</i>-value, and the <i>y</i>-intercept:
</p>
<pre>
    int m = 5;
    int x = 9;
    int b = -3;
</pre>
<p>Once those variables have been assigned,
we can compute the value of <i>y</i>:
</p>
<pre>
    int y = m * x + b;
</pre>
<p>Now, suppose we wished to find the <i>y</i>-value corresponding to
a different <i>x</i>-value or, worse yet, for a different <i>x</i>-value
on a different line. All the work we did would have to be
repeated. A <i>function</i> is a way to encapsulate all these operations
so we can repeat them with a minimum of effort.
</p>

<h2><a name="id1">Encapsulating a series of operations</a></h2><p>
First, we will define a not-too-useful function that
calculates <i>y</i>, given a slope of 5,
a <i>y</i>-intercept of -3, and an
<i>x</i>-value of 9 (exactly
as above). We do this by wrapping a function around
the sequence of operations above.
The return value of this function is the computed <i>y</i> value:
</p>
<pre>
    int
    getY(void)
        {
        int m = 5;
        int x = 9;
        int b = -3;
        return m * x + b;
        }
</pre>
<p>There are a few things to note. A function definition
begins with a type such as <code>int</code>, <code>double</code>, or <code>char *</code>.
This type 
is known as the <i>return</i> <i>type</i>. In our example,
the return type is <i>int</i>, meaning the function we are defining will
return an integer.
Following the return type
is the name of the function; the name of this
particular function is <i>getY</i>. The names of the things
being sent to the function are given between the parentheses.
If the function does not need any thing sent to it,
we use
the keyword <code>void</code> to signify this fact.
Together, the return type, the name of the function, and
the information about what needs to be sent to the function
is known as the <i>function signature</i>.
</p>
<p>The stuff indented from the function signature 
is called the <i>function body</i> and
is the code that will be evaluated (or executed) when the
function is used. You must remember this: <i>the function body
is not evaluated until the function is actually used</i>.
</p>
<p>While in many languages the name of a function is a variable,
in C the name of a function is a constant. It is, in fact, a
pseudopointer, much like the name of a statically allocated
array. Thus we cannot reassign <i>getY</i>, but we can create
a pointer that points to what <i>getY</i> points to. This thing that
<i>getY</i> points to is known as a <i>function object</i> or a <i>closure</i>.
A true pointer that points to a function object is known as a
<i>function pointer</i>. We will discuss function pointers in a later chapter.
</p>
<p>Here is a program that uses our function:
</p>
<pre>
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
    #include &lt;math.h&gt;
    #include &lt;string.h&gt;

    int getY(void);                     //function declarations go here

    int
    main(int argc,char **argv)
        {
        int result;

        result = getY();                //function call

        printf("getY returned %d\n",result);

        return 0;
        }

    int                                 //function definitions go here
    getY(void)
        {
        int m = 5;
        int x = 9;
        int b = -3;
        return m * x + b;
        }
</pre>
<p>There are a number of points to go over with respect to this program.
</p>
<ol><li>The first is we place all the signatures of the functions we write
near the top of the file. The signatures must precede any calls (or uses)
of the function. A function signature by itself
is known as a <i>declaration</i>,
as it tells the compiler that the function exists and is defined elsewhere.
Another name for a function declaration is <i>prototype</i>.
</li><li>Second, to call a function, we give the name of the
function followed by a parenthesized list of the things we want to
send to it. Since the function <i>getY</i> needs nothing, we send nothing,
signified by the empty parentheses.
</li><li>Third, we place our function definitions after the definition of <i>main</i>.
</li></ol>
<p>This placement of function definitions is not a hard and fast rule.
We could have written our program like this:
</p>
<pre>
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
    #include &lt;math.h&gt;
    #include &lt;string.h&gt;

    int                                 //function definitions go here
    getY(void)
        {
        int m = 5;
        int x = 9;
        int b = -3;
        return m * x + b;
        }

    int
    main(int argc,char **argv)
        {
        int result;

        result = getY();                //function call

        printf("getY returned %d\n",result);

        return 0;
        }
</pre>
<p>In this version, there is no need for separate function declarations
since definitions include function signatures.
Which style you use is a matter of choice.
</p>
<p>One final comment on the function declaration lines.  The use of these
declarations
is strongly encouraged.  Among other things, you will eventually
encounter situations where they are mandatory.  For example, consider
a <i>main</i> routine that calls functions <i>foo</i> and <i>bar</i>. 
During execution, <i>foo</i> will occasionally make calls to <i>bar</i> for
computations, and <tt>bar</tt> might also have to make a call to <i>foo</i>.
It is impossible to identify an order to define <i>main</i> and <i>foo</i>
and <i>bar</i> that the C compiler will accept without the use of 
function declaration lines.
</p>

<h2><a name="id2">Passing arguments</a></h2><p>
The <i>getY</i> function, as written above,
is not too useful in that we cannot use it to compute
similar things, such as the <i>y</i>-value for a different value of
<i>x</i>.
This is because we "hard-wired" the values of <i>b</i>, <i>x</i>, and <i>m</i>
in the definition of the function.
</p>
<p>A hallmark of a good function is that it lets you compute
more than one thing. We can modify our <i>getY</i> function to <i>take in</i> the
value of <i>x</i> in which we are interested.
In this way,
we can compute more than one value of <i>y</i>.
We do this by <i>passing</i> in 
some information. This information that is passed to a function in a function
call is known as
an <i>argument</i><sup><a href="index_26.html#footnote-21">21</a></sup>, in this case, the value of <i>x</i>:
</p>
<pre>
    int
    getY(int x)
        {
        int slope = 5;
        int intercept = -3;
        return slope * x + intercept;
        }
</pre>
<p>Note that we have moved the variable <i>x</i> from the body of the function
to between the parentheses. We have also refrained from
giving it a value since its value is to be sent to the function
when the function is called.
What we have done is to <i>parameterize</i> the function to make it more
general and more useful. The variable <i>x</i> is now called a
<i>formal parameter</i> since it sits between the parentheses in
the first line of the function definition.
</p>
<p>Now we can compute <i>y</i> for an infinite number of <i>x</i>'s:
</p>
<pre>
    int
    main(int argc,char **argv)
        {
        int result;

        result = getY(9);              
        printf("getY(9) returned %d\n",result);     //should be: 42

        result = getY(0);              
        printf("getY(0) returned %d\n",result);     //should be: -3

        result = getY(-2);              
        printf("getY(-2) returned %d\n",result);    //should be: -13

        return 0;
        }
</pre>
<p>What if we wish to
compute a <i>y</i>-value for a given <i>x</i> for a different
line? One approach would be to pass in the <i>slope</i> and <i>intercept</i>
as well as <i>x</i>:
</p>
<pre>
    int
    getY(int x,int m,int b)
        {
        int ans = m * x + b;
        return ans;
        }
</pre>
<p>If we wish to calculate using a different line, we just pass in the
new <i>slope</i> and <i>intercept</i> along with our value of <i>x</i>.
This certainly works as intended, but is not the best way. One problem
is that we keep on having to type in the slope and intercept even if
we are computing <i>y</i>-values on the same line. Anytime you
find yourself doing the same tedious thing over and over,
be assured that
someone has thought of a way to avoid that particular tedium.
If so, how do we
customize our function so that we only have to enter the slope
and intercept once per particular line? We'll have to postpone
these thoughts until we learn about another data structure called
<i>objects</i>.
</p>
<p>You should note that, in the last version of our <tt>getY</tt> function,
we introduced a local variable <i>ans</i>.  We calculated an answer
in <i>ans</i> and then that value was returned to the calling routine.
The variable <i>ans</i> `disappears' when the function quits.  That is,
the space that was allocated for it is freed and made available for
other uses.
</p>
<p>In any case, the
things you should take away, so far, about functions are:
</p>
<ul><li>functions encapsulate calculations
</li><li>functions can be parameterized
</li><li>functions are defined so that they may be called
</li><li>any statically declared variables in the function
are destroyed/released when the function completes
</li><li>functions return values
</li></ul>
<p>This last point is very important.
Whoever calls a function needs to handle the
return value either by assigning it to a variable or by passing it
immediately to another function (nested function calls).
Here is an example of the former:
</p>
<pre>
    y = square(x);
    z = square(y);
</pre>
<p>and here is an example of both the former and the latter:
</p>
<pre>
    z = square(square(x));
</pre>
<p>Both approaches yield identical results.
</p>

<h2><a name="id3">The Function and Procedure Patterns</a></h2><p>
When a function calculates (or obtains) a value and returns it, we say
that it implements the <i>function</i> pattern. If a function
does not have a return value, we say it implements the
<i>procedure</i> pattern.
</p>
<p>The <i>square</i> function mentioned in the previous section
is an example of the <i>function</i> pattern:
</p>
<pre>
    int
    square(x)
        {
        return x * x;
        }
</pre>
<p>This function takes a value, stores it in <i>x</i>, computes the square
of <i>x</i> and returns the result of the computation.
</p>
<p>In contrast, here is an example of the <i>procedure</i> pattern:
</p>
<pre>
    void
    displayLine(int m,int b)
        {
        printf("y = %dx + %d",m,b);
        return;
        }
</pre>
<p>We use the <code>void</code> return type to indicate procedures. Also,
we give no value for the return.
</p>
<p>Almost always,
a function that implements the <i>function</i> pattern does not print
anything, while a function that implements the procedure
pattern often does<sup><a href="index_26.html#footnote-22">22</a></sup>.
A mistake often made by beginning programmers is
to print a calculated value rather than to return it. So, when defining
a function, you should ask yourself, should I implement the function
pattern or the procedure pattern?
</p>
<p>Most of the functions you will implement in this class follow the function
pattern.
</p>

<h2><a name="id4">The dangers of functions and statically allocated arrays</a></h2><p>
A common mistake mistake made by beginners to have a function define
a statically allocated array and then attempt to return the array:
</p>
<pre>
    int *
    bundle3(int a,int b,int c)
       {
       int bundle[3];
       bundle[0] = a;
       bundle[1] = b;
       bundle[2] = c;
       return bundle;
       }

    ...
    int *p = bundle3(x,y,z); //the returned array's memory may be reused!
</pre>
<p>Modern C compilers will flag this attempt to return <i>bundle</i>.
The reason this is a bad idea is, once the function
returns, the memory reserved for the statically allocated array is
reclaimed by the system.  Remember that we had mentioned above that any
statically declared variables are released/destroyed when a function completes.
</p>
<p>While the "array" <i>p</i>, in the example above, may appear normal
for a while, once that memory allocated to <i>bundle</i> is reused, the
elements of <i>p</i> will be corrupted.
Note that this memory reuse only affects arrays statically allocated
within a function; arrays statically allocated outside of functions
last the lifetime of the program.
</p>
<p>The proper way to implement the <i>bundle3</i> function is to dynamically
allocate the array:
</p>
<pre>
    int *
    bundle3(int a,int b,int c)
       {
       int *bundle = malloc(sizeof(int) * 3);
       //check for malloc failure omitted
       bundle[0] = a;
       bundle[1] = b;
       bundle[2] = c;
       return bundle;
       }

    ...
    int *p = bundle3(x,y,z); //the returned array's memory will NOT be reused!
</pre>
<p>Our function now returns a pointer to a location that contains three integers. 
Since that location was allocated dynamically, it remains available after
the function has completed.  The user can now reference the three values
that were placed in <i>bundle</i>.  However, the user should also remember to
<tt>free</tt> that memory when it is no longer needed.  Otherwise, repeated calls
to this function will result in a memory leak that could cause issues over time.
