<h1>Starting Out</h1>
<p>A word of warning: The C programming language has a fearsome reputation
as a difficult language to learn and correctly program. This reputation
is rather undeserved. C is one of the easiest languages in which to program;
the areas that give some hackers and newbies fits are easily mastered by 
following a few simple rules.
The purpose of this text is to elucidate those rules.
</p>
<p>Most mortals cannot learn how to program by reading books.
The same is true for riding a bike or playing the piano.
They learn how to program (or ride a bike or play the piano) by practicing.
Assuming you are like most mortals, you will need to practice programming as well.
Therefore, to start, you will need to install a C compiler and an editor. 
</p>
<p>We will assume that you are using the editor and C compiler on one of three
basic types of systems, a Windows-based system that has Cygwin installed, a
Mac system, or a Debian-based system such as Ubuntu (a Unix system).
Instructions for ensuring you have an editor and C compiler installed on each
of these three types of systems can be found at
<code>http://troll.cs.ua.edu/cs100/install.html</code>
</p>
<p>Once the installation process completes,
type the command:
</p>
<pre>
    gcc --help
</pre>
<p>and press the <code>&lt;Enter&gt;</code> key.
You should be rewarded with lots of information
on how to use gcc.  This will also confirm that your system is configured 
properly and you are able to compile C programs.
</p>

<h2><a name="id1">The edit-compile-test cycle</a></h2><p>
Writing computer programs involves three tasks, identified below.
</p>
<ol><li>The developer (you) enters what is called <i>source code</i> into a file on the system.
Source code is a text version of a computer program that is readable (hopefully) by humans.
The program that you use to enter the source code text into a file is called 
an <i>editor</i>.
</li><li>A <i>compiler</i> then turns the human readable version of a program into
a form that is readable by the computer.
The computer readable form is called an <i>executable</i>.
The compiler is simply another program that exists
on the computer.  Each programming language (e.g., C, C++, 
Python, Java, Pascal, FORTRAN) has its own compiler (program) to convert source code into
an executable.
</li><li>Once the compiler has created the executable, you must ensure that the code
that you entered actually performs the required task.  You ask the computer to run 
the program to ensure that it is functioning properly.
</li></ol>
<p>At this point, you should realize that things can go wrong during the second and third
steps.  If you made mistakes when entering the source code, the compiler will discover
these errors (during step two).
When this happens, the compiler prints some ominous messages and quits.
These errors are known as compilation or <i>syntax</i> errors.
Misspellings, errors in spacing, and missing symbols at specific locations are just a 
few of the possible <i>syntax</i> errors that a compiler will identify.
Upon seeing the error messages produced by a compiler, the program writer (you)
must go back to editing the source code to remedy the situation.
</p>
<p>Once the compiler is able to successfully translate your source code into an executable
(no syntax errors exist), the program can be run and tested.
Sometimes errors occur at this stage.
For example, the program might crash, loop forever, freeze, or produce an incorrect output.
These kinds of errors are known as <i>run-time</i> or <i>logic</i> errors.
These errors are due to the fact that the set of instructions (statements) that you
entered in your program (the source code) are not logically coherent.  Think of this as
giving the wrong directions to someone trying to find Bryant-Denny Stadium.
Where they end up is not what you intended.
Again, the program writer (you) must go back to editing the source code
to fix the problems.
</p>
<p>Often, in the course
of fixing syntax errors, the program writer introduces logic errors. Just as often,
attempts to fix logic errors introduce syntax errors. And so it goes. If you are not a 
patient person and are easily frustrated, learning how to program will have some
very unpleasant moments. On the other hand, impatience and intolerance of setbacks
are not widely admired traits; sticking with programming will most assuredly cure
you of these personality defects.
</p>
<p>If all is copacetic at this point, you are ready to proceed to next chapter.
