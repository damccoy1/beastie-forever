<h2><a name="id1">While loops</a></h2><p>
Loops are used to repeatedly execute some code. The most
basic loop structure in C is the <i>while</i> loop, an example of
which is:
</p>
<pre>
    int i = 0;
    while (i &lt; 10)
        {
        printf("%d\n",i);
        i = i + 1;
        }
</pre>
<p>We see a <tt>while</tt> loop looks much like an <tt>if</tt>
statement.
The difference
is that blocks belonging to <tt>if</tt>s are evaluated at most once whereas
block associated with a loop may be evaluated many many times.
Another difference in nomenclature is that the block of a loop
is known as the <i>body</i> (like blocks associated with function
definitions). Furthermore, the loop test expression is known
as the <i>loop condition</i>.
</p>
<p>As Computer Scientists hate to type extra characters if they can
help it, you will often see:
</p>
<pre>
    i = i + 1;
</pre>
<p>written three different ways:
</p>
<pre>
    i += 1; 
    ++i;
    i++;
</pre>
<p>The latter two versions are read as "increment <i>i</i>" and
saves at least a whopping two characters of typing, more
as the variable name gets longer. The difference between
the last and the second-to-last version is when the expression
is used within a larger expression. Stylewise, this is generally
a bad idea, so until you know better, always use <code>++i</code> or <code>i++</code> as
stand-alone statements.
</p>
<p>A <i>while</i> loop tests its condition before the body of the loop is
executed. If the initial test fails, the body is not executed at all. For
example:
</p>
<pre>
    //test
    int i = 10;
    while (i &lt; 10)
        {
        printf("%d\n",i);
        ++i;
        }
    printf("[nothing should have printed]\n");
</pre>
<p>never prints out anything since the test immediately fails. In this example,
however:
</p>
<pre>
    //test
    int i = 0;
    while (i &lt; 10)
        {
        printf("%d",i);
        ++i;
        }
    printf("\n");
    printf("0123456789 should have printed\n");
</pre>
<p>the loop prints out the digits 0 through 9:
</p>
<pre>
    0123456789
</pre>
<p>A <tt>while</tt> loop repeatedly evaluates its body
as long as the loop condition remains true.
</p>
<p>To write an infinite loop, use true as the condition:
</p>
<pre>
    while (1)
        {
        i = getInput();
        printf("input is %d\n",i);
        process(i);
        }
</pre>

<h2><a name="id2">The <i>for</i> loop</a></h2><p>
The other loop in C is the
<i>for</i>
loop:
</p>
<pre>
    //test
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; ++i)
        {
        printf("%d\n",i);
        }
</pre>
<p>This loop is exactly equivalent to:
</p>
<pre>
    //test
    int i = 0;
    while (i &lt; 10)
        {
        printf("%d\n",i);
        ++i;
        }
</pre>
<p>In fact, a while loop of the general form:
</p>
<pre>
    i = INIT;
    while (i &lt; LIMIT)
        {
        // body
        ...
        i += STEP;
        }
</pre>
<p>can be written as <code>for</code> loop:
</p>
<pre>
    for (i = INIT; i &lt; LIMIT; i += STEP)
        {
        // body
        ...
        }
</pre>
<p>For loops are commonly used to sweep through each element of an array:
</p>
<pre>
    //test
    int i;
    int items[] = { 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13 };
    int itemCount = sizeof(items)/sizeof(int);

    for (i = 0; i &lt; itemCount; ++i)
        {
        printf("%d\n",items[i]);
        }
</pre>
<p>Here, we sweep through an array of integers.
Since we cannot tell, in general, the size of the array given the
name of the array, we must make available the size of the
size of the array to the loop. In the example above, the
size of the array is stored in the variable <i>itemCount</i>.
</p>
<p>Recall the items in an array of <i>n</i> elements are located at
indices <i>0</i> through <i>n - 1</i>. These are exactly the values
produced by the initialization, test, and step of the <i>for</i> loop.
The above loop accesses
each element by its index in turn, and thus prints out
each element, in turn.
Since using an index of <i>n</i> in an array of <i>n</i> items produces an
error, the test of the index <i>i</i> against the size of the array uses a
strict "less than" comparison.
</p>
<p>A common use for loops is to initialize an array. Recall that when
an array is allocated statically without initializers or is dynamically
allocated, the slots are filled with garbage. A loop can be used
to set the elements of an array to a known value:
</p>
<pre>
    array = malloc(sizeof(int) * size);
    //check for malloc failure omitted
    for (i = 0; i &lt; size; ++i)
        {
        array[i] = 0;
        }
</pre>
<p>Loops and arrays go very well
together;
the next sections detail some common loop patterns involving
arrays.
</p>

<h2><a name="id3">The <i>counting</i> pattern</a></h2><p>
The counting pattern is used to count the number of items
in a collection. Note that we require the size of the array
to be available, 
so counting the elements in an array
is a bit of a waste of time.
Still, it is about the easiest array processing
loop to write, so let's forge ahead<sup><a href="index_26.html#footnote-29">29</a></sup>
</p>
<pre>
    int i,count = 0;
    for (i = 0; i &lt; itemCount; ++i)
         {
         ++count;
         }
    //count now holds the number of items
</pre>
<p>When the loop finishes, the variable <i>count</i> holds the number of
items in the array.
In general, the counting pattern increments a counter every time the loop
body is evaluated.
</p>
<p>The counting pattern is more useful for <i>while</i> loops.
Suppose we are trying to count the number of characters in a file.
Suppose further that the function <i>getNextCharacter</i> reads and returns the
next character in a file or it returns -1 if there are no more characters to
be read. A counting loop would look like this:
</p>
<pre>
    count = 0;
    ch = getNextCharacter();
    while (ch != -1)
        {
        ++count;
        ch = getNextCharacter();
        }
    //count now holds the number of characters
</pre>
<p>At the end of the loop, <i>count</i> holds the number of characters in the file.
Note how we did not need to know the number of characters in advance. The
reason is we had a way to detect when the counting loop should stop running.
</p>

<h2><a name="id4">The <i>filtered-count</i> pattern</a></h2><p>
A variation on the counting pattern involves filtering. When <i>filtering</i>,
we use an <tt>if</tt> statement to decide whether we should count an item
or not. Suppose we wish to count the number of even items in
an array:
</p>
<pre>
    int i,count = 0;
    for (i = 0; i &lt; itemCount; ++i)
        {
        if (items[i] % 2 == 0)  //true if items[i] is even
            {
            ++count;
            }
        }
    //count now holds the number of even items
</pre>
<p>When this loop terminates, the variable <i>count</i> will hold the
number of even integers in the array of items. The <i>if</i> makes sure
the count
is incremented only when the item of interest is even.
</p>

<h2><a name="id5">The <i>accumulate</i> pattern</a></h2><p>
Similar to the counting pattern, the <i>accumulate</i> pattern
updates a variable, not by increasing its value by one, but by the value of
an item. This loop, sums all the values in an array:
</p>
<pre>
    int i,total = 0;
    for (i = 0; i &lt; itemCount; ++i)
        {
        total += items[i];      //equivalent to total = total + items[i];
        }
    //total now holds the sum of all items
</pre>
<p>By convention, the variable <i>total</i> is used to accumulate the item
values. When accumulating a sum, the total is initialized to zero. When
accumulating a product, the total is initialized to one<sup><a href="index_26.html#footnote-30">30</a></sup>.
</p>

<h2><a name="id6">The <i>filtered-accumulate</i> pattern</a></h2><p>
Similar to both the <i>filtered-count</i> pattern, the
<i>filtered-accumulate</i> pattern
updating the total only if some test is passed.
This function sums all the even values in a given array, returning
the final sum:
</p>
<pre>
    int
    sumEvens(int *items,int itemCount)
        {
        int i,total;
        total = 0;
        for (i = 0; i &lt; itemCount; ++i)
            {
            if (items[i] % 2 == 0)
                {
                total += items[i];
                }
            }
        return total;
        }
</pre>
<p>As before, the variable <i>total</i> is used to accumulate the item
values. As with a regular accumulating, <i>total</i> is initialized to zero when
accumulating a sum. The initialization value is one when
accumulating a product and the initialization value is
the empty array when accumulating an array (see <i>filtering</i> below).
</p>

<h2><a name="id7">The <i>search</i> pattern</a></h2><p>
The <i>search</i> pattern is a slight variation of <i>filtered-counting</i>.
Suppose we wish to see if a value is present in an array. We can
use a filtered-counting approach; if the count is greater than
zero, we know that the item was indeed in the array.
</p>
<pre>
    int
    occurrences(int target,int *items,int itemCount)
        {
        int i,count;
        count = 0;
        for (i = 0; i &lt; itemCount; ++i)
            {
            if (items[i] == target)
                {
                ++count;
                }
            }
        return count;
        }

    int
    find(int target,int *items,int itemCount) // is target in items?
        {
        return occurrences(target,items,itemCount) &gt; 0;
        }

</pre>
<p>In this case, <i>occurrences</i> implements the filtered-count pattern and
helps <i>find</i> do its job. We designate
such functions as <i>occurrences</i> and the like, <i>helper functions</i>.
However, we can improve the efficiency of <i>find</i> by 
having it
partially implement the filtered-count,
but short-circuiting the
search once the target item is found. We do this
by returning from the body of the loop:
</p>
<pre>
    int
    find(int target,int *items,int itemCount)
        {
        int i;
        for (i = 0; i &lt; itemCount; ++i)
            {
            if (items[i] == target)
                {
                return 1;             // short-circuit! return true
                }
            }
        return 0;   //must not be in the array, return false
        }
</pre>
<p>When the array is empty, we return false, as indicated
by the last line of the function, because the
loop never runs and thus the return inside the loop can
never be reached. In the same vein, 
if no item matches the target, we cannot return true, and
eventually the loop exits and false is returned.
</p>
<p>As a beginning programmer, however, you should be wary of returning
from the body of a loop. The reason is most beginners end up
defining the function this way instead:
</p>
<pre>
    int
    find(int target,int *items,int itemCount)
        {
        int i;
        for (i = 0; i &lt; itemCount; ++i)
            {
            if (items[i] == target)
                return 1;
            else
                return 0;
            }
        }
</pre>
<p>The first problem with this definition is that the compiler generates
a warning indicating that it is possible for the function to complete without
explicitly returning a value.
The second problems is that the function fails to find the target most times.
Unfortunately, it works correctly under some
conditions, which is why thorough testing of code is always a good thing.
If you cannot figure out why this version generates the
warning and why it
fails under some conditions but succeeds under
others, you most definitely should stay away from placing
returns in loop bodies.
</p>

<h2><a name="id8">The <i>extreme</i> pattern</a></h2><p>
Often, we wish to find the largest or smallest value
in an array. Here is one approach, which assumes that the
first item is the largest and then corrects that assumption
if need be:
</p>
<pre>
    int i,largest = items[0];
    for (i = 0; i &lt; itemCount; ++i)
        {
        if (items[i] &gt; largest)
            {
            largest = items[i];
            }
        }
    //largest now holds the largest item
</pre>
<p>When this loop terminates, the variable <i>largest</i> holds the
largest value. We can improve the loop slightly by noting
that the first time the loop body evaluates, we compare the
putative largest value against itself, which is a worthless
endeavor. To fix this, we can start the index variable <i>i</i>
at 1 instead:
</p>
<pre>
    int i,largest = items[0];
    for (i = 1; i &lt; itemCount; ++i) //start comparing at index 1
        {
        if (items[i] &gt; largest)
            {
            largest = items[i];
            }
        }
    //largest now holds the largest item
</pre>
<p>Novice programmers often make the mistake of initialing setting
<i>largest</i> to zero and then comparing all values against <i>largest</i>,
as in:
</p>
<pre>
    int i,largest = 0;
    for (i = 0; i &lt; itemCount; ++i)
        {
        if (items[i] &gt; largest)
            {
            largest = items[i];
            }
        }
    //largest may hold an incorrect value!
</pre>
<p>This code appears to work in some cases, namely if the largest
value in the array is greater than or equal to zero. If not,
as is the case when all values in the array are negative,
the code produces an spurious result of zero as the largest
value.
</p>

<h2><a name="id9">The <i>extreme-index</i> pattern</a></h2><p>
Sometimes, we wish to find the index of the most extreme
value in an array rather than the actual extreme value.
In such cases, we assume index zero holds the extreme value:
</p>
<pre>
    int i,ilargest = 0;
    for (i = 0; i &lt; itemCount; ++i)
        {
        if (items[i] &gt; items[ilargest])
            {
            ilargest = i;
            }
        }
</pre>
<p>Here, we successively store the index of the largest value
seen so far in the variable <i>ilargest</i>.
</p>

<h2><a name="id10">The <i>filter</i> pattern</a></h2><p>
A special case of a filtered-accumulation is called <i>filter</i>.
Instead of summing the filtered items (for example), we keep
the filtered items in the array. The modified array is said to be
a <i>reduction</i> of the original array.
</p>
<p>Suppose we wish to remove the odd numbers from an array. The
code looks very much like the <i>sumEvens</i> function,
but instead of adding in the desired item,
we move the even numbers to the front of the array, overwriting any odd
numbers or any previously moved even items.
</p>
<pre>
    int
    removeOdds(int *items,int itemCount)
        {
        int i,j;
        j = 0;
        for (i = 0; i &lt; itemCount; ++i)
            if (isEven(items[i]))
                {
                items[j] = items[i];
                ++j;
                }
        return j;
        }
</pre>
<p>The <i>removeOdds</i> function needs to implement the function pattern, because
we need to return the number of items that were kept in the array. This
number becomes the new size of the array. The caller of the <i>removeOdds</i>
function is responsible for updating the size of the array:
</p>
<pre>
     int data[] = {1,2,3,4,5,6};
     int size = sizeof(data) / sizeof(int);
     size = removeOdds(data,size);
</pre>
<p>Here is a pictorial view of the workings of <i>removeOdds</i>.
Suppose we start with items pointing to this array:
</p>
<div align="center">
<img scale=0.50 alt="" src="pic-loops1.png"/>
</div>
<p>Both <i>i</i> and <i>j</i>
start at zero, so they have been placed above and below slot
0. The brackets around the variables are to remind us these
variables are used as indices into the array.
When the first element is checked, we see that it is odd. We 
drop to the bottom of the loop and increment <i>i</i>,
leaving us at:
</p>
<div align="center">
<img scale=0.50 alt="" src="pic-loops2.png"/>
</div>
<p>Now, we check the element at index <i>i</i> and we see it is even. We copy
it to the slot at index <i>j</i>, overwriting the 5 that was there originally:
</p>
<div align="center">
<img scale=0.50 alt="" src="pic-loops3.png"/>
</div>
<p>We then increment <i>j</i> and then, at the bottom of the loop,
increment <i>i</i>.
Now the situation is:
</p>
<div align="center">
<img scale=0.50 alt="" src="pic-loops4.png"/>
</div>
<p>Again, the element at index <i>i</i> is even, so we copy it to slot <i>j</i>.
We then increment both <i>i</i> and <i>j</i>:
</p>
<div align="center">
<img scale=0.50 alt="" src="pic-loops5.png"/>
</div>
<p>The element at <i>i</i> is odd,
so we simply increment <i>i</i> for this iteration of the loop:
</p>
<div align="center">
<img scale=0.50 alt="" src="pic-loops6.png"/>
</div>
<p>Now the element at <i>i</i> is even, so we copy it to slot <i>j</i>.
After incrementing both <i>j</i> and <i>i</i>, we have:
</p>
<div align="center">
<img scale=0.50 alt="" src="pic-loops7.png"/>
</div>
<p>At this point, <i>i</i> is equal to <i>itemCounts</i>,
the loop ends, and we return <i>j</i>
as the new size of the array.
In the example, <i>j</i> has a value of 3. This is as desired, 
as there were three
even numbers in the original array.
</p>
<p>Of course, we are being a bit
wasteful here, in that there may be unused slots at the end of the array.
You will note that 1 and 6 remain in the array, but they have no effect
because the caller of <i>removeOdds</i> will believe the array has shrunk,
assuming the
caller properly resets the size of the array:
</p>
<pre>
    //test (compile with loops.c)
    #include "loops.h"

    int i;
    int a[] = {5,2,4,1,6};
    int aSize  = sizeof(a) / sizeof(int);

    aSize = removeOdds(a,aSize);

    for (i = 0; i &lt; aSize; ++i)
        {
        printf("[%d]",a[i]);
        }
    printf("\n");
</pre>
<p>This code should print out:
</p>
<pre>
    [2][4][6]
</pre>
<p>as desired.  
Since the original array is modified, we say that <i>removeOdds</i> is a 
<i>destructive</i> procedure. We might also say the <i>removeOdds</i> implements
a <i>destructive filtering</i> pattern.
</p>
<p>If <i>removeOdds</i> instead allocated a new array to store the even numbers,
filled that array with the even numbers found in items, and
returned the newly allocated and filled array, then <i>removeOdds</i> would
implement a non-destructive filtering pattern:
</p>
<pre>
    int
    removeOdds2(int *items,int itemCount,int *evens) //non-destructive
        {
        int i,j;
        j = 0;
        for (i = 0; i &lt; itemCount; ++i)
            if (isEven(items[i]))
                {
                evens[j] = items[i];
                ++j;
                }
        return j;
        }
</pre>
<p>In this version, we are required to pass in an array to hold the even
values:
</p>
<pre>
    //test (compile with loops.c)
    #include "loops.h"
    int i;
    int a[] = { 5, 2, 4, 1, 6 };
    int aSize = sizeof(a) / sizeof(int);
    int b[] = { 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 };
    int bSize = sizeof(b) / sizeof(int);

    bSize = removeOdds2(a,aSize,b);

    for (i = 0; i &lt; bSize; ++i)
        printf("[%d]",b[i]);
    printf("\n");
</pre>
<p>Of course, the caller must ensure that the array <i>b</i> is large enough to
hold all the even values in <i>a</i>. Most often, the array <i>b</i>
would be allocated dynamically, rather than statically:
</p>
<pre>
    ...
    int *b = (int *) malloc(sizeof(int) * aSize);
    //the test that malloc succeeded omitted
    int bSize = aSize;

    bSize = removeOdds2(a,aSize,b);
    ...
    free(b);
</pre>
<p>Rather than call <i>malloc</i> and then check if the allocation succeeded,
we can write a wrapper function that does the allocation <i>and</i>
checking:
</p>
<pre>
    char *
    allocate(int size)
        {
        char *s = malloc(size); //size given in bytes
        if (s == 0)
            {
            fprintf(stdin,"allocate: out of memory\n");
            exit(1);
            }
        return s;
        }
</pre>
<p>Now we can use <i>allocate</i> instead of <i>malloc</i>,
obviating the need for us
to write the allocation checking code. You can find a version
of <i>allocate</i> in the <i>scanner.c</i> file.
The code fragment above becomes:
</p>
<pre>
    ...
    int *b = (int *) allocate(sizeof(int) * aSize);
    int bSize = aSize;

    bSize = removeOdds(a,aSize,b);
    ...
    free(b);
</pre>
<p>From here on out, we will use <i>allocate</i> instead of <i>malloc</i>.
You would
need to include the definition of <i>allocate</i> in your code if you wish
to use it in your programming.
</p>

<h2><a name="id11">The <i>map</i> pattern</a></h2><p>
<i>Mapping</i> is a task closely coupled with that
of filtering, but rather than collecting
certain items, as with the <i>filter</i> pattern, we
collect all the items. As we collect, however,
we transform each item as
we collect it, using a passed in function.
The basic destructive pattern looks like this, with the formal
parameter <i>f</i> holding the function used to transform the
original items:
</p>
<pre>
    void
    map(int *items,int itemCount,int (*f)(int)) //destructive
        {
        int i;
        for (i = 0; i &lt; itemCount; ++i)
            items[i] = f(items[i]);      //pass items[i] through function f
        }
</pre>
<p>The type of the formal parameter <i>f</i> looks rather odd. Recall,
from the last section of the chapter
<a href="index_12.html"><i>More about Functions</i></a>,
how we derive the type of a variable that can point to a function.
Let's review with the <i>square</i> function, whose definition is:
</p>
<pre>
    int square(int x) { return x * x; } //definition
</pre>
<p>and whose signature is:
</p>
<pre>
    int square(int);                    //signature
</pre>
<p>First, we wrap the name of the function in the function signature with
parentheses:
</p>
<pre>
    int (square)(int)
</pre>
<p>Then we place an star in front of the function name (inside the parentheses
we just added):
</p>
<pre>
    int (*square)(int)
</pre>
<p>Finally,
substitute the formal parameter name for <i>square</i>:
</p>
<pre>
    int (*f)(int)
</pre>
<p>The formal paramter <i>f</i> has type <code>int (*)(int)</code>.
</p>
<p>So any time you wish to pass a function to another function, you can
follow this technique to derive the type of the formal parameter that
receives the passed-in function.
</p>
<p>Suppose we wish to subtract one from each element in an array.
First we need a transforming function that reduces its argument
by one:
</p>
<pre>
    int decrement(int);                     //signature
    ...
    int decrement(int x) { return x - 1; }  //definition
</pre>
<p>Now we can "map" the <i>decrement</i> function over an array of numbers:
</p>
<pre>
    //test (compile with loops.c)
    #include "loops.h"
    int i;
    int a[] = { 5, 2, 4, 1, 6 };
    int aSize = sizeof(a) / sizeof(int);

    map(a,aSize,decrement);

    for (i = 0; i &lt; aSize; ++i)
        printf("[%d]",a[i]);
    printf("\n");
</pre>
<p>For output, we get:
</p>
<pre>
    [4][1][3][0][5]
</pre>
<p>as expected.
</p>
<p>A non-destructive version of <i>map</i> is similar to the non-destructive
version of <i>filter</i>; we need to pass in the accepting array:
</p>
<pre>
    void
    map2(int *items,int itemCount,int (*f)(int),int *mapped) //non-destructive
        {
        int i;
        for (i = 0; i &lt; itemCount; ++i)
            mapped[i] = f(items[i]);      //pass items[i] through function f
        }
</pre>
<p>The array <i>mapped</i> should be the same size as the array <i>items</i>.
</p>

<h2><a name="id12">The <i>append</i> pattern</a></h2><p>
Sometimes, we wish to create a third  array that contains the elements
of two arrays. The <i>append pattern</i>, places the elements of
second array after the elements of the first array with all elements
placed in the third array:
</p>
<pre>
     ...
     //a and b are integer arrays with sizes aSize and bSize
     cSize = aSize + bSize;
     c = (int *) allocate(cSize * sizeof(int));

     append(a,aSize,b,bSize,c);
</pre>
<p>The definition of <i>append</i> might look like this:
</p>
<pre>
    void
    append(int *a,int aSize,int *b,int bSize,int *c)
        {
        int i,spot;
        spot = 0;
        for (i = 0; i &lt; aSize; ++i)
            {
            c[spot] = a[i];
            ++spot;
            }
        for (i = 0; i &lt; bSize; ++i)
            {
            c[spot] = b[i];
            ++spot;
            }
        //c now holds all of a and b
        }
</pre>
<p>We use index <i>i</i> to walk through the source arrays <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>
and the index <i>spot</i> to
keep track of where we are in the destination array c<i>.</i>
</p>

<h2><a name="id13">The <i>shuffle</i> pattern</a></h2><p>
When we wish to combine two arrays into a third array,
sometimes we wish to shuffle the items in the source arrays,
much like shuffling a deck of cards, rather than appending them.
</p>
<p>Here is one attempt.
The <i>shuffle</i> function places the items from the first source array in
the even locations of the destination array. Likewise,
it places items from the second source into the odd locations:
</p>
<pre>
    int *
    shuffle(int *a,int aSize,int *b,int bSize)
        {
        int *c; //a pointer to the destination array
        int i,spot;
        
        c = malloc(sizeof(int) * (aSize+bSize)); //malloc failure test omitted

        spot = 0;                       //the first even slot
        for (i = 0; i &lt; aSize; ++i)
            {
            c[spot] = a[i];
            spot += 2;                  //skip to the next even slot
            }
        spot = 1;
        for (i = 0; i &lt; bSize; ++i)     //the first odd slot
            {
            c[spot] = b[i];
            spot += 2;                  //skip to the next odd slot
            }
        //c now holds all of a and b
        return c;
        }
</pre>
<p>Note that this first version only works if the source arrays are
the same size.
Suppose the first source has the elements 3, 8, 2, 4, and 5,
while the second has the elements 7, 1, and 6. After placing the
first source, the destination arrays looks like this:
</p>
<div align="center">
<img scale=0.50 alt="" src="pic-loops8.png"/>
</div>
<p>The question marks signify holes in the array. These holes are
slots that have not been explicitly filled and thus contain
garbage, due to the
way C dynamically allocates arrays.
After adding in the second source, we have:
</p>
<div align="center">
<img scale=0.50 alt="" src="pic-loops9.png"/>
</div>
<p>Note that holes remain at the end of the destination array.
There is a worse problem, however. Presumably, the destination
array was allocated to be just big enough to hold the all the
elements in the source arrays. In our example, that would be
a size of 8. However, the last element placed, the 5, was
placed at index 8, which would be beyond the extent of
the destination array. It is clear, for mismatched source
arrays, we need a better solution.
</p>
<p>Here is one approach: we shuffle the two arrays,
as before, but stop when we run out of items in
one of the source arrays. We then fill out the
remainder of the destination array with the unused
elements in the other source array.
</p>
<p>To implement this second approach,
we will combine the two loops from the first attempt at <i>shuffle</i>,
but limit the loop's
run to the smaller of the two source array sizes:
</p>
<pre>
    spot = 0;
    for (i = 0; i &lt; aSize &amp;&amp; i &lt; bSize; ++i)
        {
        c[spot] = a[i];     //spot must be even here
        c[spot+1] = b[i];   //spot+1 therefore must be odd
        spot += 2;
        }
</pre>
<p>After this loop runs, our destination array looks like:
</p>
<div align="center">
<img scale=0.50 alt="" src="pic-loops10.png"/>
</div>
<p>with <i>spot</i> referencing the slot of the first question mark.
The variable <i>i</i>, on the other hand,
holds the index of the next element that should go into the
destination array. We don't know which, so we will attempt
to copy elements from <i>both</i> sources:
</p>
<pre>
    while (i &lt; aSize)
        {
        c[spot] = a[i];
        ++spot;
        ++i;
        }

    while (i &lt; bSize)
        {
        c[spot] = b[i];
        ++spot;
        ++i;
        }
</pre>
<p>How can this possibly work when one of the sources is all used up?
Suppose the first source is exhausted. We know that <i>i</i> must be equal
to <i>aSize</i> in that case. Therefore, the first <i>while</i>
loop test immediately
fails and the loop body is never executed. We continue on to the
next loop, where <i>i</i> must hold the index of first unused element in
the second source. We continue to copy elements over into the
destination array until the source is exhausted.
</p>
<p>Conversely, if the <i>for</i> loop ends with the second source exhausted,
we copy over elements from the first source. At this point, the variable
<i>i</i> is greater than the size of the second source, so the second <i>while</i>
loop immediately fails. In either case, the destination array
holds all the elements of the source arrays with the elements shuffled
as much as possible. Putting it all together yields the following
implementation for shuffle:
</p>
<pre>
    int *
    shuffle(int *a,int aSize,int *b,int bSize)
        {
        int *c; //a pointer to the destination array
        int i,spot;
        
        c = malloc(sizeof(int) * (aSize+bSize)); //malloc failure test omitted

        //shuffle until one source is exhausted
        spot = 0;
        for (i = 0; i &lt; aSize &amp;&amp; i &lt; bSize; ++i)
            {
            c[spot] = a[i];     //spot must be even here
            c[spot+1] = b[i];   //spot+1 therefore must be odd
            spot += 2;
            }

        //i is either equal to aSize or bSize
        //spot holds the index of the 1st available slot in c

        // copy over leftover elements in a, if any
        while (i &lt; aSize)
            {
            c[spot] = a[i];
            ++spot;
            ++i;
            }

        // copy over leftover elements in b, if any
        while (i &lt; bSize)
            {
            c[spot] = b[i];
            ++spot;
            ++i;
            }

        //c now holds the shuffle of a and b
        return c;
        }
</pre>
<p>With this new version, what happens when the sizes of the source
arrays are equal? The superior student will quickly ascertain the
validity of the new version in this case.
</p>
<p>One last note: the three pieces of a <i>for</i> loop, INIT, LIMIT, and STEP,
are all optional. We could replace the first <i>while</i>
loop with this <i>for</i> loop:
</p>
<pre>
        for ( ; i &lt; aSize; ++i) //i starts at its previous value
            {
            c[spot] = a[i];
            ++spot;
            }
</pre>
<p>The second <i>while</i> loop could be replaced in a similar fashion.
</p>

<h2><a name="id14">The <i>merge</i> pattern</a></h2><p>
With the <i>shuffle</i> pattern, we always took the head elements from both
arrays at each step in the shuffling process.
Sometimes, we wish to place a constraint of the choice of elements.
For example, suppose the two arrays to be combined are sorted
and we wish the resulting array to be sorted as well. The
following example shows that shuffling does not always work:
</p>
<pre>
    //test (compile with scanner.c and loops.c)
    #include "scanner.h"
    #include "loops.h"

    int i;
    int a[] = {1,4,6,7,8};   //a is sorted
    int b[] = {2,3,9};       //b is sorted
    int *c;
    int aSize,bSize,cSize;

    aSize = sizeof(a) / sizeof(int);
    bSize = sizeof(b) / sizeof(int);

    c = shuffle(a,aSize,b,bSize);
    cSize = aSize + bSize;

    for (i = 0; i &lt; cSize; ++i)
        printf("[%d]",c[i]);
    printf("\n");
</pre>
<p>Running this code gives us the following output:
</p>
<pre>
    [1][2][4][3][6][9][7][8]
</pre>
<p>Clearly, the destination array <i>c</i> is not sorted.
</p>
<p>The <i>merge</i> pattern is used to ensure the resulting array is
sorted and is based upon the <i>filtered-accumulate</i> pattern.
The twist is we only accumulate an item <i>if</i> it is the smallest item
in the two arrays that has not already been accumulated.
We start by keeping two index variables,
one pointing to the smallest element in the first source and
one pointing to the smallest element in second source.
Now, we loop, similar to <i>shuffle</i>. The difference is we
will only advance the index variable of a source array <i>if</i>
we use the smallest of its unused elements:
</p>
<pre>
    i = 0;          //index of the smallest unused element in a
    j = 0;          //index of the smallest unused element in b
    spot = 0;
    while (i &lt; aSize &amp;&amp; j &lt; bSize)
        {
        if (a[i] &lt; b[j])    //a's element is smaller, use it
            {
            c[spot] = a[i];
            spot++;
            i++;
            }
        else                //b's element is smaller, use it
            {
            c[spot] = b[j];
            spot++;
            j++;
            }
        }
</pre>
<p>Inside the loop, we test to see if the smallest unused element
in <i>a</i> is smaller than the smallest unused element in <i>b</i>.
If it is, we copy the element from <i>a</i> to <i>c</i> and increment
<i>a</i>'s
index variable, "using up" the smallest unused value.
Likewise, we do the same for <i>b</i> if <i>b</i>'s element is smaller.
</p>
<p>The <i>while</i> loop ends when one of the source arrays is exhausted.
At this point, we just copy over the elements in the unexhausted
source, just the same as we did for <i>shuffle</i>. Putting it
all together yields:
</p>
<pre>
    int *
    merge(int *a,int aSize,int *b,int bSize)
        {
        int *c; //a pointer to the destination array
        int i,j,spot;
        
        c = malloc(sizeof(int) * (aSize+bSize)); //malloc failure test omitted

        //merge until one source is exhausted
        spot = 0;
        for (i = 0,j = 0; i &lt; aSize &amp;&amp; j &lt; bSize; ++spot)
            {
            if (a[i] &lt; b[j])    //a's element is smaller, use it
                {
                c[spot] = a[i];
                i++;
                }
            else                //b's element is smaller, use it
                {
                c[spot] = b[j];
                j++;
                }
            }

        //i is either equal to aSize or j is equal to bSize
        //spot holds the index of the 1st available slot in c

        // copy over leftover elements in a, if any
        for ( ; i &lt; aSize; ++i)
            {
            c[spot] = a[i];
            ++spot;
            }

        // copy over leftover elements in b, if any
        for ( ; j &lt; bSize; ++j)
            {
            c[spot] = b[j];
            ++spot;
            }

        //c now holds the shuffle of a and b
        }
</pre>
<p>The main <i>while</i> loop has been rewritten as a <i>for</i> loop
by taking advantage
of <i>for</i> loop flexibility. Note we can initialize two (or more) variables
in the INIT portion of the loop by separating the initializations with
a comma. We also moved the increment of spot to the STEP portion
since we increment spot regardless of the which array held the smaller
value. We do <i>not</i> want to increment <i>i</i> and <i>j</i>
in the STEP portion since
those indices only get incremented when their arrays hold the smallest
unused elements.
</p>

<h2><a name="id15">The <i>fossilized</i> pattern</a></h2><p>
Sometimes, a loop is so ill-specified that it never ends. This
is known as an <i>infinite loop</i>. Of the
two loops we are investigating, the <i>while</i> loop is the most
susceptible to infinite loop errors. One common mistake
is the <i>fossilized</i> pattern, in which the index variable never
changes so that the loop condition never becomes false:
</p>
<pre>
    i = 0;
    while (i &lt; n)
        {
        printf("%d\n",i);
        }
</pre>
<p>This loop keeps printing until you terminate the program with
prejudice. The reason is because <i>i</i> never changes; presumably a
statement to increment <i>i</i> at the bottom of the loop body has
been omitted.
</p>

<h2><a name="id16">The <i>missed-condition</i> pattern</a></h2><p>
With the missed condition pattern, the index variable is updated, but
it is updated in such a way that the loop condition
never evaluates to false.
</p>
<pre>
    i = getAnInteger();
    while (i != 0)
        {
        printf("%d\n",i);
        i -= 2;
        }
</pre>
<p>If the <i>getAnInteger</i> returns a positive, even number, then the loop
terminates as expected. However, if <i>getAnInteger</i> returns 
an odd or negative number, the loop never ends. Suppose <i>i</i> starts
out with the value 5. The loop test keeps succeeding and the value of
<i>i</i> keeps being printed:
</p>
<pre>
    5
    3
    1
    -1
    -3
    -5
    -7
    ...
</pre>
<p>Here, the variable <i>i</i> has skipped over the value used for
terminating the loop; <i>i</i> never becomes zero.
Thus, the loop condition never fails and the loop
becomes infinite.
