<h2><a name="id1">List/Loop patterns</a></h2><p>
For every array pattern, there is a corresponding list pattern.
Sometimes, the pattern is easier to implement with an array than
a loop. Sometimes, the opposite is true. The next sections
will detail patterns for lists.
</p>

<h2><a name="id2">The <i>append</i> pattern</a></h2><p>
Adding values to the front of a list is known as <i>prepending</i>,
so <i>join</i><sup><a href="index_26.html#footnote-36">36</a></sup>
prepends a value to a list.
Instead of adding new values to the front,
we can also add values to the back of the list. Such a procedure
is termed <i>appending</i>; Since lists at this point are nodes,
we can append a list with either a single node or a list.
In this section, we will focus an appending a list with another list:
</p>
<pre>
    void
    append(Node *listA,Node *listB) //listA length must be &gt; 0
        {
        while (tail(listA) != 0)
            {
            listA = tail(listA); //move to the next node in the list
            }
        setTail(listA,listB);
        return;
        }
</pre>
<p>Here, we start out with the formal parameter <i>listA</i> pointing
to the first node in the list passed as <i>listA</i>.
Then, as long as <i>listA</i>'s <i>next</i> pointer points to a node
and not null<sup><a href="index_26.html#footnote-37">37</a></sup>,
we set <i>listA</i> to the next node in the list by taking the tail.
We repeat this process
until we reach the last node in the list, whose <i>next</i> pointer does
indeed point to null. At this point, we drop out of the loop and set the
next pointer of this last node to <i>listB</i> via <i>setTail</i>.
Suppose we call append with two lists, alpha and beta:
</p>
<pre>
    append(alpha,beta);
</pre>
<p>Here is the view just before <i>append</i> walks the first list:
</p>
<div align="center">
<img scale=0.50 alt="" src="pic-list-loop1.png"/>
</div>
<p>Immediately after dropping out of the loop, the local variable
<i>listA</i> points to the last node in the list:
</p>
<div align="center">
<img scale=0.50 alt="" src="pic-list-loop2.png"/>
</div>
<p>After the reassingment of the tail pointer of the adjusted <i>listA</i>,
we can see that <i>alpha</i> now incorporates the nodes of <i>beta</i>:
</p>
<div align="center">
<img scale=0.50 alt="" src="pic-list-loop3.png"/>
</div>
<p>Note that while <i>head</i> and <i>tail</i>
are non-destructive operations,
<i>append</i> is a destructive
operation, since one pointer in an original list is actually changed.
Generally, you can quickly tell if a function is destructive or
non-destructive by looking at the return value. If the function
implements the <i>procedure</i> pattern, it is likely destructive. If
it implements the <i>function</i> pattern, it is likely non-destructive<sup><a href="index_26.html#footnote-38">38</a></sup>.
</p>
<p>To test append, we need to create some lists:
</p>
<pre>
    //test (compile with ilist.c and listLoop.c)
    #include "listLoop.h"
    Node *a,*b;
    a = join(2,join(4,join(6,0)));
    b = join(1,join(3,join(5,0)));
    displayList(a);
    displayList(b);
    append(a,b);
    displayList(a);
</pre>
<p>The output for this program is:
</p>
<pre>
    {2}{4}{6}
    {1}{3}{5}
    {2}{4}{6}{1}{3}{5}
</pre>
<p>The last line in the output comes from the last displayIntegerList. This
clearly shows that <i>append</i> is doing its job.
</p>
<p>If we wish to append a single value to a list, we can turn
the single value into a list first:
</p>
<pre>
    //test (compile with ilist.c and listLoop.c)
    #include "listLoop.h"
    Node *a,*b;
    a = join(2,join(4,join(6,0)));
    b = newNode(1,0);
    append(a,join(b,0)); //incorporate b into a list
    displayList(a);
</pre>
<p>The process of moving from one node to the next in a list is known
as <i>walking</i> the list. Obviously, the longer the list, the longer
it takes to walk it. Thus, appending to a list can take much
longer than prepending to the same list, since prepending takes the
same amount of time regardless of how long the list is.
However, as you will learn in a subsequent data structures
class, there is a much faster way to append to a list. If you cannot
wait to find out this clever implementation of <i>append</i>, search for
the phrase "linked list tail pointer" on the interwebs.
</p>
<p>We can use the idea of walking a list to implement some more
useful list functions. The <i>getListIndex</i> function returns
the value at the <i>i<sup>th</sup></i> node in a given list:
</p>
<pre>
    int
    getListIndex(Node *items,int index)
        {
        while (index &gt; 0)
            {
            items = tail(items);
            --index;
            }
        return head(items);
        }
</pre>
<p>Note that taking the tail of a list does not alter the original list
in any way; the list that is passed in is unchanged by this function<sup><a href="index_26.html#footnote-39">39</a></sup>.
Finally, consider if there are fewer nodes in the
list than is specified by the index.
This implementation, like many C built-in functions,
does no error checking. 
What happens if the list is too short for the given index is
undefined (but it will likely be very bad).
The analogous <i>setListIndex</i> is left as an exercise.
</p>

<h2><a name="id3">The <i>search</i> pattern</a></h2><p>
This idea of walking lists is an extremely important concept;
so important that we will review the two "walks" that
are commonly needed when manipulating lists. The first is
walking to a certain location in list. Usually, one walks to
index (covered previously) or to a value. Of course, walking
to a value is simply the search pattern, implemented for lists.
Here is a search function that works on <i>Integer</i> lists:
</p>
<pre>
    Node *
    findInteger(int value,Node *items)
        {
        while (items != 0 &amp;&amp; head(items) != value)
            {
            items = tail(items);
            }
        return items;
        }
</pre>
<p>Note that this version returns the node containing the value if the value is
found and the null pointer otherwise.
Because of the possibility that a value
may not be in the list, we must add the condition <code>items != 0</code> to
the while loop test. If we didn't, then <i>items</i> would eventually reach
0 and the <i>head</i> operation on the null pointer
would likely generate a crash.
Sometimes, <i>find</i> would be written with a simpler
loop test, but complicated by a return from the body of the loop:
</p>
<pre>
    Node *
    findInteger2(int value,Node *items)
        {
        while (items != 0)
            {
            if (head(items) == value)
                 {
                 return items;
                 }
            items = tail(items);
            }
        return 0;
        }
</pre>
<p>These two implementations are semantically equivalent;
the former is usually preferred
stylistically, but the latter is likely more common.
</p>

<h2><a name="id4">The <i>trailing walk</i> pattern</a></h2><p>
The second walk one is likely to encounter is a walk to the next-to-the-last
node in a list, which is useful in many situations: removing the last item,
adding an item just prior to the last item,
and so on.
</p>
<p>One must walk the list to get to the penultimate node. Here is one
attempt; it keeps two pointers when walking the list, a leading
pointer and a trailing pointer that stays one node behind the leader.
The walk ends when the <i>next</i> pointer of the leading node becomes null.
We call this pattern the <i>trailing walk pattern</i>:
</p>
<pre>
    Node *
    getPenultimateNode(Node *items)
        {
        Node *trailing = 0;
        Node *leading = items;
        while (tail(leading) != 0) //when to stop walking
            {
            trailing = leading;
            leading = tail(leading);
            }
        return trailing;
        }
</pre>
<p>If we walked until the lead node became null, then the trailing node
would be the last node in the list, not the next-to-the-last node.
However, checking the next pointer of a node is a dangerous proposition.
What happens in the case of an empty list?
How many nodes must be in a list for this function to work properly?
Highlight the following line to see the answers:
</p>
<div class="quote">
[<font color="#ffffff"> When passed an empty list, the <i>tail</i>
operation in the
loop test will generate an error. Therefore, there must be at least one
node in the list.</font>]
</div>
<p>The above approach can be simplified by checking if the trailing pointer's
next pointer points to a node whose next pointer is null. Although the
check is a bit more complicated, it obviates the need for the leading
node:
</p>
<pre>
    Node *
    getPenultimateNode2(Node *items)
        {
        Node *trailing = items;
        while (tail(tail(trailing)) != 0)
            {
            trailing = tail(trailing);
            }
        return trailing;
        }
</pre>
<p>The two versions of <i>getPenultimateNode</i>
are similar, but not exactly equivalent.
How many nodes must be in a list for the second version to work properly?
Highlight the following line to see the answers:
</p>
<div class="quote">
[<font color="#ffffff"> There must be at least two nodes in the list.</font>]
</div>
<p>To test these implementations, we will create a list and then
print the value of the penultimate node:
</p>
<pre>
    //test (compile with ilist.c and listLoop.c)
    #include "listLoop.h"
    Node *a,*n,*m;
    a = join(newInteger(2),join(newInteger(4),join(newInteger(6),0)));
    n = getPenultimateNode(a);
    printf("n is %d\n",getIntegerValue(head(n)));
    m = getPenultimateNode2(a);
    printf("m is %d\n",getIntegerValue(head(m)));
</pre>
<p>Both version produce 4, as expected.
</p>
<p>An application of the trailing walk pattern is to insert a value into
an ordered list so that the list remains ordered<sup><a href="index_26.html#footnote-40">40</a></sup>.
For example, suppose we have an
ordered list consisting of the numbers 1, 3, 8, 14, and 17:
</p>
<p>If we wish to insert 10 into the list, we must place the 10 between the
8 and the 13 so that the list values remain in increasing order (from left
to right). To simplify the making of an integer
Using <i>getPenultimateNode</i> as a starting point, we have:
</p>
<pre>
    void
    insertIntegerInOrder(int value,Node *items)
        {
        Node *trailing = 0;
        Node *leading = items;
        while (...) //when to keep walking
            {
            trailing = leading;
            leading = tail(leading);
            }
        //insert new value in between trailing and leading
        ...
        }
</pre>
<p>The ellipses mark where changes to the trailing value pattern need
to be made. The first ellipsis (the while test) should force the
walk to stop when the correct insertion point is found. Clearly,
that is when leading value is greater than the value to be inserted.
The second ellipsis concerns how the actual
insertion is to be performed. We know we will need to:
</p>
<ul><li>create a new node
</li><li>set the new node's value pointer to the value to be inserted
</li><li>set the new node's next pointer to the leading node
</li><li>set the trailing node's next pointer to the new node
</li></ul>
<p>All that's left then is to fill in the blanks. Here is the result:
</p>
<pre>
    void
    insertInOrder(int value,Node *items)
        {
        Node *trailing = 0;
        Node *leading = items;
        while (head(leading) &lt; value) //when to keep walking
            {
            trailing = leading;
            leading = tail(leading);
            }
        //insert new value in between trailing and leading
        Node *n = newNode(value,0);
        setTail(n,leading);     //place n before leading
        setTail(trailing,n);    //place n after trailing
        }
</pre>
<p>Note that we want to <i>stop</i> when the leading value is <i>greater</i>
than
the value to be inserted. Since we are working with a while
loop, we need to reverse the logic so that the walk <i>continues</i>
as long as the leading value is <i>less than</i> the new value<sup><a href="index_26.html#footnote-41">41</a></sup>.
</p>
<p>Let's test our code:
</p>
<pre>
    //test (compile with ilist.c and listLoop.c)
    #include "listLoop.h"
    int numbers[] = {1,3,8,13,14,17};
    Node *a = arrayToList(numbers,sizeof(numbers)/sizeof(int));
    insertInOrder(10,a);
    displayList(a);
</pre>
<p>Compiling and running this code yields:
</p>
<pre>
    {1}{3}{8}{10}{13}{14}{17}
</pre>
<p>It appears our code works correctly! The 10 is nestled nicely between
the 8 and the 13. Very exciting! Unfortunately,
the excitement
of getting code to work seduces both novice and experienced Computer
Scientists alike into thinking the task is finished. Many times, including
this case in particular, initial success only means the basic idea is correct,
not that the code is correct for all possible inputs. Indeed, for our implementation
of <i>insertOrder</i>, there are <i>edge cases</i> for which this code
fails. An edge case is a set of inputs that force the code to do
as much (or as little) work as possible. For <i>insertInOrder</i>, what
inputs causes the function to do as much work as possible?
The only place where a variable amount of work is performed is the
loop that walks the list. In order to make the loop go as many times
as possible, it is clear that we would need to insert a value at
the very end of the list. Changing the line:
</p>
<pre>
    insertInOrder(20,a);    //was: insertInOrder(10,a);
</pre>
<p>yields the following result when the program is run:
</p>
<pre>
    Segmentation fault      (core dumped) ./a.out
</pre>
<p>Likewise, making the loop do as little work as possible yields
errors in the code. What inputs would cause the loop run very little
or not at all? Obviously,
if the value to be inserted is smaller than any value in the list,
the loop does not need to be run. Less obviously, what if the given
list is empty?
Fixing <i>insertInOrder</i> to handle these edge cases is left as an exercise.
</p>

<h2><a name="id5">The <i>counting</i> pattern</a></h2><p>
The counting pattern is very important for lists, since we can
use that pattern to deduce the
number of items in a list:
</p>
<pre>
    int
    length(Node *items)
        {
        int count = 0;
        while (items != 0)                //typical list walking condition
            {
            ++count;
            items = tail(items);          //typical list walking step
            }
        }
</pre>
<p>Traditionally, the function that counts the number of items in
a list is called <i>length</i>.
As with the counting pattern for arrays,
each "step" taken results in a counter being
incremented.
</p>

<h2><a name="id6">The <i>filtered-accumulation</i> pattern</a></h2><p>
A filtered accumulation looks similar to the counting pattern.
Here is a function that totals up all the even values in a list:
</p>
<pre>
    int
    sumEvenIntegers(Node *items)
        {
        int total = 0;
        while (items != 0)
            {
            int v = head(items);
            if (v % 2 == 0)
                total += v;
            items = tail(items);
            }
        return total;
        }
</pre>

<h2><a name="id7">The <i>extreme</i> pattern</a></h2><p>
Once you have the hang of walking a list, most patterns become
trivial to implement. Here is an instance of the extreme pattern:
</p>
<pre>
    int
    getLargest(Node *items)
        {
        int largest = head(items); //assume first is largest
        while (items != 0)
            {
            int v = head(items);
            if (v &gt; largest)
                largest = v;
            items = tail(items);
            }
        return largest;
        }
</pre>
<p>This implementation looks very much like the extreme pattern for arrays,
only translated to list walking.
</p>
<p>Surprisingly or, maybe, not surprisingly, the <i>extreme index pattern</i> is
much more difficult to implement for lists than for arrays.
This is because the
basic walk of a list ignores the index of a particular node.
In general, any processing that requires the manipulation of indices
will be more complicated
with a list as compared to an array.
The implementation of the extreme index pattern is left as
an exercise.
</p>

<h2><a name="id8">The <i>copy</i>, <i>filter</i> and <i>map</i> patterns</a></h2><p>
Lists lend themselves to non-destructive
copying, filtering, and mapping. As the original list is walked and
values processed, a new list holding the original, filtered, or mapped
values is built up. One slight problem arises when
loops are used to walk the list. Since lists are
grown using <i>join</i>, the elements in the new list are
found
in the opposite order as compared to their associated elements
in the original list.
If the order of the
result doesn't matter, then lists and loops go well together for
this kind of processing. If the order does matter,
then another way of walking list, using recursion, can be used to
preserve order. We will cover recursion in the next chapter.
</p>
<p>Here is code which copies a list.
</p>
<pre>
    Node *
    copyList(Node *items)
        {
        Node *result = 0;   //resulting list starts out empty
        Node *spot = items;
        while (spot != 0)           //walk the list
            {
            result = join(head(spot),result); //add current value to result
            spot = tail(spot);                //take a step
            }
        return result;
        }
</pre>
<p>In almost all list processing functions, we see the basic walk of the
list. Indeed, should you be tasked to define a list processing function,
you would be well advised to start with a basic walk and then modify
as needed.
</p>
<p>Testing the <i>copyList</i> function reveals the reordering of the original
values:
</p>
<pre>
    //test (compile with listLoop.c)
    #include "listLoop.h"
    int numbers[] = {1,3,8,13,14,17};
    Node *a = arrayToList(numbers,sizeof(numbers)/sizeof(int));
    Node *b = copyList(a);
    displayList(a);
    displayList(b);
</pre>
<p>Compiling and running this code yields:
</p>
<pre>
    {1}{3}{8}{13}{14}{17}
    {17}{14}{13}{8}{3}{1}
</pre>
<p>Filtering and mapping are based
off of the copy pattern. Here is a function
the filters out odd-valued integers:
</p>
<pre>
    Node *
    extractEvens(Node *items)
        {
        Node *result = 0;
        while (items != 0)
            {
            int v = head(items);
            if (isEven(v))
                result = join(head(items),result);
            items = tail(items);
            }
        return result;
        }
</pre>
<p>Note how the resulting list is grown every time an even valued item
is found in the original list. Testing the function:
</p>
<pre>
    //test (compile with ilist.c and listLoop.c)
    #include "listLoop.h"
    int numbers[] = {1,3,8,13,14,17};
    Node *a = arrayToList(numbers,sizeof(numbers)/sizeof(int));
    Node *b = extractEvenIntegers(a);
    displayIntegerList(b);
    displayIntegerList(b);
</pre>
<p>yields:
</p>
<pre>
    {1}{3}{8}{13}{14}{17}
    {14}{8}
</pre>
<p>The even numbers from the original list are found in the resulting list
in the opposite order.
</p>

<h2><a name="id9">The <i>shuffle</i> and <i>merge</i> patterns</a></h2><p>
As with arrays, shuffling and merging lists using loops is
rather complicated.
So much so that we will not
even bother discussing loop-with-list versions.
However, using recursion with lists greatly
simplifies this type of processing, as we shall
see in the next chapter.
</p>

<h2><a name="id10">The <i>fossilized</i> pattern</a></h2><p>
The primary reason for accidentally implementing the fossilized
pattern is to forget the while loop update. For example, while
this loop:
</p>
<pre>
    while (items != 0)
        {
        //loop body here
        ...
        items = tail(items);      //update, often accidentally omitted
        }
</pre>
<p>may have been intended, what sometimes happens is the 
update to <i>items</i> is omitted.
Since items is never updated, it never advances to the null
pointer
(unless, of course, it
was an empty list to begin with). This leads to an infinite loop.
</p>

<h2><a name="id11">Freeing lists</a></h2><p>
Since our lists are dynamically allocated, we need to free them
when we are done with them:
</p>
<pre>
    void
    freeList(Node *items)
        {
        Node *spot;
        while(items != 0)
            {
            spot = items;
            items = tail(items);
            free(spot);                //free the current node
            }
        }
</pre>
<p>The only complication to this procedure is the need to save the lead
node
of the list before advancing to the next node.
This is because, once we free something,
we cannot reference any part of it. Thus, the sequence:
</p>
<pre>
    free(items);            //free the current node
    items = tail(items);    //WRONG!
</pre>
<p>will end in grief. The second statements asks for a part of the node
(the value of the next pointer), <i>after</i> the node has been freed.
Note that this routine does not free the values of a node. For integer
nodes, this is not an issue. For string-valued nodes, where the strings
were <i>malloc</i>-ed, the freeList function would be modified to
free those strings:
</p>
<pre>
    void
    freeList(Node *items)
        {
        Node *spot;
        while(items != 0)
            {
            spot = items;
            items = tail(items);
            free(spot-&gt;value);
            free(spot);                //free the current node
            }
        }
</pre>

<h2><a name="id12">Why Lists?</a></h2><p>
You may be asking, why go through all this trouble to implement lists
when arrays seem to do every thing lists can do. The reason
comes down to the fact that no data structure does all things well.
For example, a data structure may be very fast when putting values
in, but very slow in taking values out. Another kind of data structure
may be very slow putting values in but very fast taking values out.
This is why there are quite a number of different data structures,
each with their own strengths.
</p>
<p>Arrays versus Lists:
</p>
<ul><li>Accessing any element in an array is very fast,
regardless of the size of the array. In contrast, the larger the list,
the more time it takes to access values near the end  of the list.
</li><li>Dynamically allocated arrays can be allocated and freed in a single step.
Freeing a list means freeing every node in the list in turn.
</li><li>Adding a value to the front of a list is very fast; adding a value
to the end of a list can be made very fast. In contrast, adding
an element to a (full) array means a new larger array has to be allocated
and elements of the old array copied over to the new array.
</li><li>Lists and recursion go very well together; arrays, not so much.
We will use lists heavily in the next chapter on recursion.
</li></ul>

<h2><a name="id13">Problems</a></h2>
<ol><li>Assume a list holds the values 3, 8 and 10. Draw a box and pointer
diagram of this list.
</li><li>Why does the for loop in the <i>intsToList</i> function (in <i>integers.c</i>):
<pre>
    for (i = size-1; i &gt;= 0; --i)
</pre>
<p>decrement the loop index?
</li><li>Assume a list holds the values 3 and 8. Consider appending the value 5.
Draw a set of box and pointer diagrams, similar to those used in the
discussion of <i>join</i>, that illustrate the action of <i>append</i>.
You should have a drawing of the situation before the while loop begins,
one for each update of the variable node while the loop is running, one
after the new node is created, and one showing the list just before the
function returns. Label your drawings appropriately.
</li><li>Define a function named <i>appendValue</i>, which takes a list and
an <code>int</code> value and appends the value to a list of <i>Integer</i> values.
Your function should look very similar to
<i>append</i>.
</li><li>The module <i>lists.c</i>
exhibits an important principle in Computer Science, <i>abstraction</i>.
The list operations treat nodes as abstract objects; that is to say,
lists do not know nor care about how nodes are constructed. Verify this
is true by renaming the variables in the Node structure and
updating the accessors and mutators of nodes accordingly.
Now test the list operations to see that
they work exactly as before.
</li><li>The list operation <i>getListIndex</i> as found in the <i>lists.c</i> module
exhibits another important concept in
Computer Science, <i>generalization</i>. Since both <i>getListIndex</i>
and <i>setListIndex</i>
need to walk the list, that list-waking code was generalized into the function
<i>getListIndexedNode</i>.
Modify the <i>lists.c</i> module so that <i>getListIndex</i>
and <i>setListIndex</i>
each walk the list.
Both operations should function as before, but you should notice how similar
they look. When you see such similarity, the similar code is a candidate
for generalization.
</li><li>Define a function named <i>reverse</i>, which takes a list as an argument and
returns a new list with the same items as the given list, but in the opposite order.
</li><li>Define a function named <i>copy2</i>, which takes a list as an argument and
returns a copy of the list. The new list should have the same ordering
as the original list.
</li><li>Define a function named <i>chop</i>, which takes a list as an argument and
destructively removes the last element of a list. Your function should look similar
to <i>getPenultimateNode</i>.
</li><li>Define a function named <i>equals</i>, which takes two lists as arguments and
returns whether or not the two lists have the same elements in the same order.
</li><li>The linked lists developed in this chapter are known as <i>singly</i>-linked lists,
a class of lists with a single pointer links a node to the next node in the list.
Another class of lists, <i>doubly</i>-linked lists,
provide an additional pointer from a node to
its predecessor. Define a constructor for nodes upon which doubly-linked lists could
be based.
</li><li>Fix the given version of <i>insertIntegerInOrder</i>
so that it correctly handles edge cases.
</li><li>Implement a function that finds the index of the largest element in
the list. Do not use <i>getListIndex</i> or anything like it.
</li><li>Consider the version of <i>insertIntegerInOrder</i> given in this chapter.
If a value to be inserted matches a value already in the list, does the new
value end up before or after the old value? How would you change the code
to get the opposite behavior?
