<h2> Introduction
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

A good programmer needs to
develop a coding style that is both readable and
maintainable (by both you and others). So it is not sufficient for
you to simply understand sequence, selection, iteration, recursion,
functions
and the other material in CS 100. You must also be able to apply
these concepts in programs that exhibit proper style.
<br/>
<br/>
The standard speech you will hear on style is that you should be able
to take any piece of code that you write and hand it to another individual
who understands the langauge
and they can easily read it, understand it, and modify it without hassles.
<br/>
<br/>
Now that you are actually writing problems of more than just a few lines,
we are introducing some <b>required</b> style guidelines that will be
enforced for your programming projects.
The purpose of these guidelines is to help ensure that using proper
programming style becomes second nature to you.
Please realize that failure to follow these style guidelines
will result in lost points on the projects.
<br/>
<!-- subsection -->
<h3> Comments
<br/>
</h3><!-- subsection ENDED -->

Make sure that your program is properly commented. For any
program that you write, you should be able to hand that code to
someone else and expect them
to be able to understand your logic and processes. This includes:
<br/>

<ul>

<li>

 Header Comments:
You must provide a series of comments at the top of any program
or module that describes the purpose of the file and the authorship.
Such comments are known as {it header comments}.
Remember, if you are modifying the work of another author (and have permission
to do so), you must follow the original author's instructions for
modification. At a minimum, you must add comments indicating your
authorship and the reasons for the modifications.
</li>

<li>

 Function Comments:
You must provide comments immediately prior to each function describing
the purpose of the function. The more well-named your function and
formal parameters are, the more succinct these comments can be.
</li>

<li>

 Inline Code Comments:
You must provide comments of sections of code whose purpose would not
be immediately obvious to a reader of the code. A good rule of thumb for
this is as follows - if you had to think about the code before writing it
(it was not incredibly obvious what was needed), then you should include a
comment for this section of code.
</li>

</ul>

<h3> Spacing, Indentation and Braces
<br/>
</h3><!-- subsection ENDED -->

With these items,
consistency is the key to
readability. We expect to see a consistent pattern with spacing,
indentation and braces throughout the
entire program. Shifting from one convention to another causes
confusion on the part of the person reading the code. This includes:
<br/>

<ul>

<li>

 Indentation:
You must use consistent indentation schemes to indicate the body
of functions and the statements or blocks belonging to conditionals
and loops.
</li>

<li>

 Braces: There are several standard conventions for where to
place the braces with functions, loops, and conditionals. The
convention that you pick must be used consistently throughout your
program.
</li>

<li>

 Spacing: Blank lines for readability and spacing around operators
and variables within a statement also define your coding style. You
should ensure that whatever style you select is done consistently
throughout the program.
</li>

</ul>


<!-- subsection -->
<h3> Input
<br/>
</h3><!-- subsection ENDED -->

Input is free-format. This generally means that any amount of whitespace
may separate and terminate tokens in the input.
Specific project instructions may alter these restrictions.
<br/>
<!-- subsection -->
<h3> Output
<br/>
</h3><!-- subsection ENDED -->

There are two types of output, token-oriented output and line-oriented
output. There should be no whitespace preceding the first
printable character and no whitespace following the last printable
character of token-oriented output.
For line-oriented output, each line should be terminated with a single
newline with no whitespace preceding the newline. As with token-oriented
output, there should be no preceding whitespace on any line.
Specific project instructions may alter these restrictions.
<br/>
<!-- subsection -->
<h3> C-Specific Requirements
<br/>
</h3><!-- subsection ENDED -->

The following style requirements are
specific to the C programming language.
<br/>

<ul>

<li>

 Non-parameterized Functions:
For all functions that you write which take no arguments,
you must indicate the lack of formal parameters with the keyword 
<code>void</code>,
as in 
<code>int f(void);</code>
</li>

<li>

 Default Types:
You must explicitly state all types; using default types is forbidden.
</li>

<li>

 Function Length:
Functions should never (well, hardly ever) exceed 25 lines in length. That is,
the entire function should be visibile in a default terminal window. One can
generally make a function smaller by replacing code representing some task
with a well-named function to perform that task.
</li>

<li>

 Line Length:
No line should exceed more than 80 characters,
as line wrapping makes code difficult to read.
With today's screen resolutions and good eyesight, it is possible to
declare terminal windows that have widths of 150 to 200 characters.
However, not everyone takes advantage of this capability. Lines that are
longer than 80 characters can quickly turn code unreadable when viewed
in a different environment.
</li>

<li>

 Main Signatures:
The main function must have one of the following signatures, depending on
whether or not you are using command-line arguments in your program:
<br/>

<pre>
    int main(int argc,char *argv[]);
    int main(int argc,char **argv);
    int main(void);
</pre>

</li>

<li>

 Compiler Warnings:
You must compile with the 
<code>-Wall</code> and 
<code>-Wextra</code> flags.
You must remove all compiler errors and warnings before submitting your code.
<br/>
</li>

<li>

 Assertions:
You should liberally use assertions to enforce preconditions and postconditions
in your functions.
</li>

</ul>
