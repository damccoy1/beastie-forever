<h2> The <i>CDA</i> class
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

For your circular dynamic array class, the header file, <i>cda.h</i>, should look
like:
<br/>

<pre>
    #ifndef __CDA_INCLUDED__
    #define __CDA_INCLUDED__

    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

    typedef struct cda CDA;

    extern CDA *newCDA(void);
    extern void setCDAdisplay(CDA *items, void (*display)(void *,FILE *));
    extern void setCDAfree(CDA *items, void (*free)(void *));
    extern void insertCDA(CDA *items,int index,void *value);
    extern void *removeCDA(CDA *items,int index);
    extern void unionCDA(CDA *recipient,CDA *donor);
    extern void *getCDA(CDA *items,int index);
    extern void *setCDA(CDA *items,int index,void *value);
    extern int  sizeCDA(CDA *items);
    extern void displayCDA(CDA *,FILE *);
    extern int  debugCDA(CDA *,int level);
    extern void freeCDA(CDA *);

    #define insertCDAfront(items,value) insertCDA(items,0,value)
    #define insertCDAback(items,value)  insertCDA(items,sizeCDA(items),value)
    #define removeCDAfront(items)       removeCDA(items,0)
    #define removeCDAback(items)        removeCDA(items,sizeCDA(items)-1)

    #endif
</pre>

The header file contains the function signatures of your public
methods while the code module, <i>cda.c</i>, contains their implementations.
<br/>
<br/>
The only local includes that <i>cda.c</i> should have is <i>cda.h</i>.
<br/>
<!-- subsection -->
<h3> Method behavior
<br/>
</h3><!-- subsection ENDED -->

Here are some of the behaviors your methods should have. This listing
is not exhaustive; you are expected, as a computer scientist, to
complete the implementation in the best possible and most logical manner.
The circular dynamic array uses zero-based indexing.
<br/>

<ul>

<li>

 <i>newCDA</i> -
The constructor returns an initialized <i>CDA</i> object.
<br/>
</li>

<li>

 <i>insertCDA</i> -
This insert method places the item in the slot named by the given index.
The previous item at that slot shifts to the next higher slot (and so on).
If there is no room for the insertion, the array grows by doubling.
It should run in amortized constant time when inserting an item a constant
distance from the front or back and in linear time otherwise.
<br/>
</li>

<li>

 <i>removeCDA</i> -
This remove method removes and returns the item named by the given index.
The item at the next higher slot shifts to that slot (and so on).
If the ratio of the size to the capacity drops below 25%,
the array shrinks by half. The array should never shrink below
a capacity of one.
Also, an empty array should always have a capacity of one.
It should run in amortized constant time when removing an item a constant
distance from the front or back and in linear time otherwise.
It runs in amortized constant time.
<br/>
</li>

<li>

 <i>unionCDA</i> -
The union method takes two array and moves all the items in the
donor array to the recipient array. If the recipient array has the
items 
<code>(3,4,5)</code> and the donor array has the items 
<code>(1,2)</code>,
then, after the union, the donor array will be empty and recipient
array will have the items 
<code>(3,4,5,1,2)</code>.
It should run in amortized linear time
with respect to the size of the donor array.
<br/>
</li>

<li>

 <i>getCDA</i> -
The get method returns the value at the given index,
from the perspective of the user. In the user's view, the
first item is at index zero, the second item at index 1, and
so on. So this routine has to translate between the users view and
the internal view (where the first item can be anywhere in the
underlying array.
It runs in constant time.
<br/>
</li>

<li>

 <i>setCDA</i> -
The set method updates the value at the given index,
from the perspective of the user.
If the given index is equal to the size, the value is inserted via
the <i>insertCDAback</i> method.
If the given index is equal to -1, the value is inserted via
the <i>insertCDAfront</i> method.
The method returns the replaced value or the null pointer
if no value was replaced.
It runs in constant time if the array does not need to grow and
amortized constant time if it does.
<br/>
</li>

<li>

 <i>sizeCDA</i> -
The size method returns the number of items stored in the array.
<br/>
</li>

<li>

 <i>displayCDA</i> -
This visualizing method prints out the filled region, enclosed in
parentheses and
separated by commas, followed by the size of the unfilled region, enclosed
in brackets.
If the
integers 5, 6, 2, 9, and 1 are stored in the array (listed from
index 0 upwards)
the method would generate this output:

<pre>
    (5,6,2,9,1)
</pre>

with no preceding or following whitespace.
If no display method is set, the address of each item is printed
(using 
<code>%p</code>). Each address is preceded by an @ sign.
<br/>
</li>

<li>

 <i>debugCDA</i> -
The debug method sets an internal flag in the object to the given value.
If the flag is greater than zero, the display method adds a comma (if needed)
and the number
of empty slots (in brackets) immediately after the last element.
If the above array had a capacity of 8,
the display would be 
<code>(5,6,2,9,1,(3))</code>.
An empty array with capacity 1
displays as 
<code>((1))</code>.
The method returns the previous debug value.
<br/>
</li>

<li>

 <i>freeCDA</i> -
If no free method is set, the individual items are not freed.
In any case, the array and its supporting allocations are freed.
</li>

</ul>

<h3> Assertions
<br/>
</h3><!-- subsection ENDED -->

Include the following assertions in your methods:
<br/>

<ul>

<li>

<br/>
</li>

<li>

 <i>insertCDA</i> -
The index shall be valid.
<br/>
</li>

<li>

 <i>removeCDA</i> -
The index shall be valid.
The size shall be greater than zero.
<br/>
</li>

<li>

 <i>getCDA</i> -
The index shall be greater than or equal to zero and less than the size.
<br/>
</li>

<li>

 <i>setCDA</i> -
The index shall be greater than or equal to -1 and less than or
equal to the size.
</li>

</ul>

<h3> Testing your CDA class
<br/>
</h3><!-- subsection ENDED -->

Modify the testing program found in the
<a href="http://beastie.cs.ua.edu/cs201/assign-sll.html">sll class description</a>
to work with circular dynamic arrays. Make sure you add additional
testing to make sure the time constraints of all methods are met.
