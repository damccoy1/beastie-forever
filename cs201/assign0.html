<h2> Introduction
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

For your first programming assignment,
you are to build the beginnings of a library of elementary data structures.
This initial library will consist
of a dynamic array class,
a circular dynamic array class,
a stack class,
and a queue class.
The stack class is to be built upon the dynamic array class, while
the queue class is to be built upon the circular dynamic array class.
The language of implementation is Portable C99.
Each of the four classes need to be
implemented in its own module.
<br/>
<br/>
The classes need to be generic. That is, the type of the value stored in
a node object will not be specified by the any of the classes.
The user of your
array, stack, and queue classes will determine the type of value
stored in these data structures.
<br/>
<!-- section -->
<h2> Specifications
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

The specifications for your classes can be found here:
<br/>

<ul>

<li>

 <a href="http://beastie.cs.ua.edu/cs201/assign-da.html">dynamic arrays</a>
<br/>
</li>

<li>

 <a href="http://beastie.cs.ua.edu/cs201/assign-cda.html">circular dynamic arrays</a>
<br/>
</li>

<li>

 <a href="http://beastie.cs.ua.edu/cs201/assign-stack.html">stacks</a>
<br/>
</li>

<li>

 <a href="http://beastie.cs.ua.edu/cs201/assign-queue.html">queues</a>
</li>

</ul>


You must program these data structures using the style outlined in
<a href="http://beastie.cs.ua.edu/C-objects.html" style="font-size:10px,font-family:'Lucida Console',monospace">http://beastie.cs.ua.edu/C-objects.html</a>.

<h2> Generic data pointers
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

Generic values in C are stored in 
<code>void *</code> pointers. Any data pointer
can be stored in a 
<code>void *</code> pointer with no cast:
<br/>

<pre>
      void *p = newINTEGER(5);
</pre>

Assigning a void pointer to a specific type also does not require a cast:
<br/>

<pre>
      void *p = newINTEGER(5);
      INTEGER *q = p;
</pre>

It is a grave error to cast a 
<code>void *</code> pointer to a type that does not
reflect the original value stored in the 
<code>void *</code> pointer.
<br/>
<!-- section -->
<h2> Function pointers
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

You can pass a function to another function in C by using a function
pointer. Suppose you wish to pass a function with this signature:
<br/>

<pre>
    int plus(int,int);
</pre>

to a function named <i>accumulate</i>, in addition to an array of
integers. The signature of <i>accumulate</i> would be:
<br/>

<pre>
    int accumulate(int *array,int size,int (*combine)(int,int));
</pre>

That third argument is a function pointer. To derive the proper
function pointer type, simply take the signature of the function to be
passed and perform the following transformations:
<br/>

<pre>
    int plus(int,int);      //original signature
    int plus(int,int)       //remove the semicolon
    int (plus)(int,int)     //wrap the function name in parens
    int (*plus)(int,int)    //place an asterisk immediately before the function name
    int (*combine)(int,int) //change the name of the function to the name of the formal parameter
</pre>

Inside the <i>accumulate</i> function, the <i>combine</i> function pointer can
be called like a regular function:
<br/>

<pre>
    total = combine(total,array[i]);
</pre>

<!-- section -->
<h2> Programming style
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

You must implement your data structures in C99.
You must follow the C programming style guide for this project:
<a href="http://beastie.cs.ua.edu/cs201/cstyle.html" style="font-size:10px,font-family:'Lucida Console',monospace">http://beastie.cs.ua.edu/cs201/cstyle.html</a>.
<br/>
<!-- section -->
<h2> Makefiles
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

You should provide a <i>makefile</i> which responds to the commands:
<br/>

<ul>

<li>

 make
</li>

<li>

 make test
</li>

<li>

 make valgrind
</li>

<li>

 make clean
</li>

</ul>


All compilations should proceed
cleanly with no warnings or errors
at the highest level of error checking (the

<code>-Wall</code> and 
<code>-Wextra</code> options). Failure to
compile cleanly
will be considered a failed test.
<br/>
<br/>
The 
<code>make</code> command should compile all your modules, if they
have not already been compiled. A second call to 
<code>make</code> in
two consecutive calls to 
<code>make</code> should never result in a module
being compiled or linked.
<br/>
<br/>
The 
<code>make test</code> command runs all your tests on your implementations.
You should provide sufficient testing, especially testing the
boundaries of your data structures. Examples of boundary
testing are:
<br/>

<ul>

<li>

 displaying an empty stack
</li>

<li>

 printing the size of an empty stack
</li>

<li>

 having a stack go non-empty, then empty, and then non-empty again
</li>

<li>

 put a large number of values into a stack and then removing most of them
</li>

</ul>


The 
<code>make valgrind</code> command should run valgrind on all your executables,
one test per executable.
There should be no memory errors or leaks detected.
Failure to properly implement this makefile rule will be considered a
failed test. If your executable is named <i>mytest</i>, then your valgrind
rule might look like:
<br/>

<pre>
    valgrind: mytest
        valgrind ./mytest
</pre>

The 
<code>make clean</code> command should remove all object files and
any executables. Failure to remove such files will be considered a failed
test
<br/>
<!-- section -->
<h2> Warnings
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

Depending on where you develop your code,
uninitialized variables may have a
tendency to start with a value of zero. Thus, a program with uninitialized
variables may work on
your system but fail when I run it. I won't care, as you are mature enough
not to have uninitialized variables. You may have other errors as well
that do not reveal themselves until run on my system. Again,
that's not my problem. USE VALGRIND!
<br/>
<br/>
At any time, you may submit your project to the <i>compile</i> drop box, which
will send you a report on how well the compilation went. Use this command
to submit to this drop box:
<br/>

<pre>
    submit cs201 lusth compile
</pre>

Submissions to the drop box will be automatically compiled, on the order of
every 5 minutes.
<br/>
<br/>
You can automatically
test your programs by submitting them to the <i>test0</i>
dropbox:
<br/>

<pre>
    submit cs201 lusth test0
</pre>

This dropbox will run 
<code>make clean</code>, 
<code>make</code>, and 
<code>make test</code> in that order.
Your tests should be run by 
<code>make test</code>. A few additional tests will be
run as well, to make sure you have submitted all the modules you need to.
<br/>
<br/>
You will need a password in order to submit. Do not ask for the password
on any public forum.
<br/>
<!-- section -->
<h2> Documentation
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

All code you hand in must be
attributed to its authors. Comment sparingly but well. Do explain the
purpose of your program. Do not explain obvious code. If code is not
obvious, consider rewriting the code rather than explaining what is
going on through comments.
<br/>
<!-- section -->
<h2> Grading
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

The output of your programs and modules
will be tested using the <i>diff</i> utility.
Your ouput and the expected output must match exactly. A single extra
space or a space in the wrong place will cause a test to fail, leading
to a resubmission with an accompanying deduction.
<br/>
<!-- section -->
<h2> Submission
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

To submit assignments, you need to install the <i>submit</i> system.
<br/>

<ul>

<li>

 <a href="linux.html">linux, windows 10 bash</a>
</li>

<li>

 <a href="mac.html">mac instructions</a>
</li>

</ul>


You will hand in (electronically) your code for
final testing with the
command:
<br/>

<pre>
    submit cs201 lusth assign0
</pre>

Make sure you are in the same directory as your makefile when
submitting.
The submit program will bundle up all the files in your current
directory and ship them to me.
Thus it is very important that only the source code and any testing
files
be in your directory.
This includes subdirectories as well since
all the files in any subdirectories will also be shipped to me.
You may submit as many times as you want before the deadline; new
submissions replace old submissions. Old submissions are stored and
can be used for backup.
Do not submit large test files.
<br/>
<br/>
You will need a password in order to submit. Do not ask for the password
on any public forum.
