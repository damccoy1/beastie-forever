<h2> Introduction
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

You will compare the performance of green binary search trees versus
red-black trees by reading in a corpus of text, storing the word and phrases
therein
into a search tree, and then performing operations on the resulting
tree.
A green tree is just like a regular binary search tree except that
it can store duplicates in an efficient way.
Your red-black tree will efficiently store
duplicates as well.
However, the plain binary search tree module upon which your green
and red-black trees are based
will not.
<br/>
<br/>
The corpus will be stored in a file; phrases will be delineated
by double quotes while tokens will be sequences of non-quote, non-whitespace
characters. Whitespace consists primarily of the characters
space, tab, and newline.
<br/>
<br/>
Commands for manipulating the tree composed of corpus
entities will be stored in a file as well.
Here is a list of commands your application should handle:
<br/>
<span class="indent">
<table>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left";> 
<code>i W</code> </td><td style="text-align:left";> insert word or phrase 
<code>W</code> into the tree </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left";> 
<code>d W</code> </td><td style="text-align:left";> delete word or phrase 
<code>W</code> from the tree </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left";> 
<code>f W</code> </td><td style="text-align:left";> report the frequency of word or phrase 
<code>W</code> </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left";> 
<code>s</code> </td><td style="text-align:left";> show the tree </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left";> 
<code>r</code> </td><td style="text-align:left";> report statistics </td>
</tr>
</table>


</span>

<br/>
All words that are inserted into a tree
should be composed of letters from the
ASCII character set 
<code>[a-z]</code>; phrases may possibly contain
spaces as well.
Both words and phrases should be <i>cleaned</i>.
In the case of words, cleaning means all undesirable characters are to be
removed and uppercase characters translated to lowercase.
For example, the word 
<code>Joy&#39;s.</code> would be rendered as 
<code>joys</code>.
The same is true for phrases, but after cleaning, any leading
or trailing whitespace should be removed and any contiguous
whitespace in the interior should be replaced by a single space.
For example, the phrase 
<code>&quot;  by  ,    and</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<code>by&quot;</code> would become

<code>&quot;by and by&quot;</code>.
Do not insert empty words or phrases or phrases with only spaces
into the tree.
<br/>
<br/>
For green and red-black trees, inserting
a word already in the tree would increase its frequency count by one. When
deleting a word from the tree, its frequency count
should be reduced by one.
If the frequency count goes to zero, the
corresponding node should be removed from the tree.
<br/>
<br/>
When showing the tree, display the nodes with
a breadth-first (left-first) traversal. All nodes at a given level
should be on the same line of output. The level number should precede
the display of the nodes at that level. Display each node according to
the following format:
<br/>

<ul>

<li>

 an equals sign if the node is a leaf, followed by
</li>

<li>

 the node value, followed by
</li>

<li>

 a frequency count (if the count is greater than one), followed by
</li>

<li>

 a balance factor, either 
<code>+</code> or 
<code>-</code>
(if the balance factor is not zero), followed by
</li>

<li>

 a parenthesized display of the parent, followed by
</li>

<li>

 an 
<code>X</code> if the node is the root,
an 
<code>L</code> if the node is a left child,
and an 
<code>R</code> otherwise
</li>

</ul>


Your display function must run in linear time.
Note that you will need to add a <i>displayBSTdecorated</i> method to
your BST class in order to
add the leaf, root, left child, and right
child decorations to the level order display of the tree.
You will need an red-black-specific and private display function
(call it <i>adisplay</i>),
which you will passed to the BST constructor.
The <i>adisplay</i> function will
handle the frequency count and balance factor decorations.
It will also handle the actual display of the
generic value by using
the original display function passed to the red-black constructor.
<br/>
<br/>
Note also that the parent of the root is itself.
Green tree nodes do not have balance factors.
Here is an example of a red-black tree:
<br/>

<pre>
    0: beta(beta)X
    1: =alpha(beta)L =gamma(beta)R
</pre>

Note that each value occurs once in the tree above.
Note also, that this could also be a green tree display.
Here is another:
<br/>

<pre>
    0: beta-(beta-)X
    1: =alpha(beta-)L gamma+(beta-)R
    2: =delta&lt;2&gt;(gamma+)L 
</pre>

If the balance factor is a negative one, a minus sign is
printed. If the balance factor is a positive one, a plus
sign is printed.
The corpus to generate such a tree might look like:
<br/>

<pre>
    beta alpha
      gamma
          delta
</pre>

The words should be ordered within a tree in case-insensitive
lexicographic ordering. Suppose the corpus was:
<br/>

<pre>
    The &quot;quickity quick&quot; brown fox
         jumped over the girl
             and her lazy, lazy dog.
</pre>

found in a file named <i>data</i>. Suppose the file <i>commands</i>
holds the command:
<br/>

<pre>
    s
</pre>

Then a display of a green tree generated by this corpus would
look like this:
<br/>

<pre>
    $ trees -g data commands
    0: the&lt;2&gt;(the&lt;2&gt;)X
    1: quickity quick(the&lt;2&gt;)L
    2: brown(quickity quick)L
    3: =and(brown)L fox(brown)R
    4: =dog(fox)L jumped(fox)R
    5: girl(jumped)L over(jumped)R
    6: =her(girl)R =lazy&lt;2&gt;(over)L

</pre>

When the corpus
is inserted into a red-black tree, the resulting
structure would look like this:
<br/>

<pre>
    $ trees -r data commands
    0: jumped(jumped)X
    1: fox(jumped)L quickity quick+(jumped)R
    2: brown(fox)L girl-(fox)R over+(quickity quick+)L =the&lt;2&gt;(quickity quick+)R
    3: =and(brown)L =dog(brown)R =her(girl-)R =lazy&lt;2&gt;(over+)L
</pre>

The display of an empty tree should generate the following line of output:
<br/>

<pre>
    EMPTY
</pre>

The statistics to be reported are:
<br/>

<ul>

<li>

 the number of duplicates in the tree
</li>

<li>

 the number of nodes in the tree
</li>

<li>

 the minimum depth, which is the distance from the root to the closest node with a null child pointer
</li>

<li>

 the maximum depth, which is the distance from the root to the furthest node with a null child pointer
</li>

</ul>


If the root had a null child, the minimum depth would be 0.
Here is an example statistics report:
<br/>

<pre>
    Duplicates: 2
    Nodes: 8
    Minimum depth: 2
    Maximum depth: 4
</pre>

Here is an example frequency report:
<br/>

<pre>
    Frequency of albatross: 5
</pre>

All output must be formatted as shown. Each line of output
should have no leading whitespace, no trailing whitespace (except
the mandatory newline), no interstitial whitespace except spaces,
and no more than one space in a row.
<br/>
<!-- section -->
<h2> Commands
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

The commands will be read from a free format text file; individual
tokens may be separated by arbitrary amounts of whitespace.
For example, these three file contents
are all legal and equivalent:
<br/>

<pre>
    i spongebob
    i &quot;Bikini Bottom&quot;
    f Patrick
    s
</pre>

or
<br/>

<pre>
    i spongebob i &quot;Bikini Bottom&quot; f Patrick s
</pre>

or
<br/>

<pre>
    i spongebob i
        &quot;Bikini Bottom&quot; f

        Patrick

    s
</pre>

<!-- section -->
<h2> Error handling
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

You should ignore, but report
an attempt to delete something that does
not exist in the tree. Thus you ought to be able to randomly generate
a large number commands and have your application run without failing.
The error message printed when attempting to delete a value not in
the tree should have the form:
<br/>

<pre>
    Value x not found.
</pre>

There should be no quotes around the value.
Normally,
one would print error messages to <i>stderr</i>, but for testing purposes,
print them to <i>stdout</i>.
<br/>
<!-- section -->
<h2> Program organization
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

The tree portion of your code should be composed of four modules:
<br/>

<ul>

<li>

<a href="http://beastie.cs.ua.edu/cs201/assign-tnode.html" style="font-size:10px,font-family:'Lucida Console',monospace">http://beastie.cs.ua.edu/cs201/assign-tnode.html</a>.
<br/>
</li>

<li>

<a href="http://beastie.cs.ua.edu/cs201/assign-bst.html" style="font-size:10px,font-family:'Lucida Console',monospace">http://beastie.cs.ua.edu/cs201/assign-bst.html</a>.
<br/>
</li>

<li>

<a href="http://beastie.cs.ua.edu/cs201/assign-gst.html" style="font-size:10px,font-family:'Lucida Console',monospace">http://beastie.cs.ua.edu/cs201/assign-gst.html</a>.
<br/>
</li>

<li>

<a href="http://beastie.cs.ua.edu/cs201/assign-rbt.html" style="font-size:10px,font-family:'Lucida Console',monospace">http://beastie.cs.ua.edu/cs201/assign-rbt.html</a>.
</li>

</ul>


A <i>GST</i> object should use a <i>BST</i> object as a client,
reusing as much of the <i>BST</i> methods as possible.
Likewise, an <i>RBT</i> object should have a <i>GST</i> object
as a client.
As an example, the size method for
<i>GST</i> should return
the number of nodes via the <i>BST</i> size method
and the size method for <i>RBT</i> should use the
<i>GST</i> method.
Another example is that a <i>GST</i> delete
method should simply make a call to <i>deleteBST</i>.
An <i>RBT</i> delete method, on the
other hand, would
make a call to <i>swapToLeafGST</i>, followed by a call to a
deletion fixup routine, and finally followed by a call to <i>pruneLeafGST</i>.
<br/>
<br/>
The <i>GST</i> will need its own value object
to insert in a <i>BST</i>. This value object will
hold the given generic value and a
frequency count fields.
Likewise, the
<i>RBT</i> will need to a value object to add in
a color field.
In addition to the extra fields,
these specialized value objects may need to pointers
to the display and freeing methods of the generic object
as well as the comparator.
<br/>
<!-- section -->
<h2> Compliance
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

The <i>swapToLeafBST</i> function should prefer swapping with a successor over
swapping with a predecessor.
<br/>
<br/>
The <i>pruneLeafBST</i> should not decrement the size of the BST. Only the
<i>deleteBST</i> method should decrement the count. Therefore, the <i>deleteRBT</i>
method will need to adjust the BST size.
The <i>insertGST</i> and <i>deleteGST</i> methods should just
use <i>insertBST</i> and <i>deleteBST</i>, respectively.
<br/>
<br/>
The insertion and deletion fixup routines for <i>RBT</i> trees
must follow the
<a href="http://beastie.cs.ua.edu/red-black">pseudocode</a>
found on the Beastie website.
<br/>
<br/>
If a newline is to be printed, there can
be no preceding qhitespace.
No lines of output are indented.
<br/>
<br/>
Note that during some tests, your <i>BST</i>, your <i>GST</i>, and your <i>RBT</i>
module will be replaced. In others, your modules will be tested in
isolation, so do not add any additional public interface
methods or includes.
<br/>
<br/>
You are required to use the <i>test2</i> drop box prior to submission.
<br/>
<br/>
Reuse your code from previous assignments. Do not modify your
library structures unless explicitly instructed.
<br/>
<!-- section -->
<h2> Program invocation
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

Your program will process a free-format corpus of text and a free-format
file
containing an arbitrary number of commands.
The name of the corpus
and the file of commands will be passed to the interpreter as a command
line arguments. Switching
between the two tree implementations is to be accomplished by providing
the command line options -g (green tree) and -r (<i>RBT</i> tree). Here
is an example call to your interpreter:
<br/>

<pre>
    trees -g corpus commands
</pre>

where <i>corpus</i> is a file of text and <i>commands</i> is the name of a file which
contains a sequence of commands. In executing this call, you would read
the words found in <i>corpus</i>, store them into a simple binary search tree,
and the process the sequence of commands found in <i>commands</i>. Both
the corpus and the commands
file may be empty.
<br/>
<br/>
Your executable should handle a '-v' option. With this option, your executable
should print the author's name and immediately exit with a zero error code,
performing no other work.
<br/>
<br/>
If no 
<code>-g</code> or 
<code>-r</code> function is given, you application should assume
an <i>RBT</i> tree.
<br/>
<br/>
Either the corpus or the commands may be empty, possibly both.
<br/>
<!-- section -->
<h2> Program output
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

All
output should go to the console (stdout).
When processing commands, only
the result should be echoed;
the command should not be
echoed.
<br/>
<br/>
The <i>insert</i> and <i>delete</i> commands
do not have a printable result and therefore
should be processed silently.
<br/>
<!-- section -->
<h2> Documentation
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

All code you hand in should be attributed to the author. Comment
sparingly but well. Do explain the purpose of your program. Do not
explain obvious code. If code is not obvious, consider rewriting the
code rather than explaining what is going on through comments.
<br/>
<!-- section -->
<h2> Project compilation
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

You must implement your modules in C99.
You must provide a file named <i>makefile</i>,
which responds properly to the commands:
<br/>

<pre>
    make 
    make test
    make clean
    make valgrind
</pre>

The 
<code>make</code> command compiles your program, which should compile
cleanly with no warnings or errors
at the highest level of error checking (the

<code>-Wall and -Wextra options</code>).
The 
<code>make test</code> command should test your program and
the 
<code>make clean</code> command should remove object files and
the executable.
<br/>
<br/>
The compilation command
must name the executable <i>trees</i> (not <i>trees.exe</i> for you
poor Cygwin users).
You may develop on any system you wish but
your program will be compiled and tested on a Linux system.
Only the most foolish
students would not thoroughly test their implementations on
a Linux system before submission.
Note: depending on where you develop your code,
uninitialized variables may have a
tendency to start with a value of zero. Thus, a program with uninitialized
variables may work on
your system but fail when I run it.
<br/>
<br/>
The correctness and efficiency of your makefile will be tested.
You must have the correct dependencies and your makefile should not
perform any unnecessary compilations.
<br/>
<!-- section -->
<h2> Grading
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

You must pass all tests for your program to be graded.
<br/>
<!-- section -->
<h2> Handing in the application
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

For preliminary testing,
run a 
<code>make clean</code> and then
send me all the files in your directory by running the command:
<br/>

<pre>
    submit cs201 lusth test2
</pre>

For your final submission, run a 
<code>make clean</code> and use the command:
<br/>

<pre>
    submit cs201 lusth assign2
</pre>

Again, your implementation may be developed on other hardware and
operating systems, but it must also compile and run cleanly and
correctly on a Linux system.
