<h1>Parameter Passing</h1>
<p>There are (at least) six historical and current
methods of passing arguments to a function when a function call
is made. They are:
</p>
<ul><li><i>call-by-value</i>
</li><li><i>call-by-reference</i>
</li><li><i>call-by-value-result</i>
</li><li><i>call-by-name</i>
</li><li><i>call-by-need</i>
</li><li><i>call-by-name-with-thunks</i>
</li></ul>
<p>Let's examine these six methods in turn. After which, we will
investigate variadic functions in Scam.
</p>

<h2><a name="id1">Call-by-value</a></h2><p>
This method is the only method of parameter passing allowed by C, Java,
Scam, and Scheme. In this method, the formal parameters are set up as local
variables that contain the value of the expressions that were passed as
arguments to the function. Changes to local variables are not reflected
in the actual arguments. For example, an attempt to define a function
for exchanging the values
of two variables passed to it might look like:
</p>
<pre>
    (define (swap a b)
        (define temp a)
        (set! a b)
        (set! b temp)
        )
</pre>
<p>Consider this code which uses <i>swap</i>:
</p>
<pre>
    (define x 3)
    (define y 4)

    (swap x y)

    (inspect x)
    (inspect y)
</pre>
<p>Under <i>call-by-value</i>,
this function would not yield the intended semantics.
The output of the above code is:
</p>
<pre>
    x is 3
    y is 4
</pre>
<p>This is because only the values of the local variables <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>
were swapped; the variables <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> remain unchanged
as only their values were passed to the swapping function.
In
general, one cannot get a swap routine to work under <i>call-by-value</i>
unless the addresses of the variables are somehow sent. One way of
using addresses is to pass an array (in C and Scam, when an array name
is used as an argument, the address of the first element is sent. In Java,
the address of the array
object is sent). For example,
the code fragment:
</p>
<pre>
    (define x (array 1))
    (define y (array 0))

    (swap x y)  ;address of beginning element is sent

    (println "x[0] is " (getElement x 0) " and y[0] is " (getElement y 0))
</pre>
<p>with <i>swap</i> defined as...
</p>
<pre>
    (define (swap a b)
        (define temp (getElement a 0))
        (setElement a 0 (getElement b 0))
        (setElement b 0 temp)
        )
</pre>
<p>would print out:
</p>
<pre>
    x[0] is 0 and y[0] is 1
</pre>
<p>In this case, the addresses of arrays <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>
are stored in the local variables <i>a</i> and
<i>b</i>, respectively.
This is
still call-by-value since even if the address stored in <i>a</i>, for example,
is modified,
<i>x</i> still "points" to the same array as before. Here is an example:
</p>
<pre>
    (define (change a)
       (assign a (array 13))
       )

    (define x (array 42))

    (inspect (getElement x 0))
</pre>
<p>yields:
</p>
<pre>
    (getElement x 0) is 42)
</pre>
<p>Note that C has an operator that extracts the address of a variable, the
&#38; operator. By using &#38;, one can write a swap in C that does
not depend on arrays:
</p>
<pre>
    void swap(int *a,int *b)
        {
        int temp;
        temp = *a;
        *a = *b;
        *b = temp;
        }
</pre>
<p>The call to <i>swap</i> would look like:
</p>
<pre>
    int x = 3;
    int y = 4;

    swap(&amp;x,&amp;y);

    printf("x is %d and y is %d\n",x,y);
</pre>
<p>with output:
</p>
<pre>
    x is 4 and y is 3
</pre>
<p>as desired.
</p>
<p>Note that this is still <i>call-by-value</i> since the <i>value</i> of the
address of <i>x</i> (and <i>y</i>) is being passed to the swapping function.
</p>

<h2><a name="id2">Call-by-reference</a></h2><p>
This second method differs from the first in that changes to
the formal parameters during execution of the function body are
immediately reflected in actual arguments. Both C++ and Pascal allow
for call-by-reference. Normally, this is accomplished,
under the hood, by passing the
address of the actual argument (assuming it has an address) rather than
the value of the actual argument. References to the analogous formal
parameter are translated to references to the memory location stored in
the formal parameter. In C++, <i>swap</i> could be defined as:
</p>
<pre>
    void swap(int &amp;a, int &amp;b) // keyword &amp; signifies
        {                     // call-by-reference
        int temp = a;
        a = b;
        b = temp;
        }
</pre>
<p>Now consider the code fragment:
</p>
<pre>
    var x = 3;  //assume x at memory location 1000
    var y = 4;  //assume y at memory location 1008

    //location 1000 holds a 3
    //location 1008 holds a 4

    swap(x,y);
    cout &lt;&lt; "x is " &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; " and y is " &lt;&lt; y &lt;&lt; "\n";
</pre>
<p>When the swapping function starts executing, the value 1000 is stored
in the local variable <i>a</i> and 1008 is stored in local variable <i>b</i>.
The line:
</p>
<pre>
    temp = a;
</pre>
<p>is translated, not into store the value of <i>a</i> (which is 1000) in
variable <i>temp</i>, but rather store the value at memory location 1000 (which
is 3) in variable <i>temp</i>. Similar translations are made for the remaining
statements in the function body. Thus, the code fragment prints out:
</p>
<pre>
    x is 4 and y is 3
</pre>
<p>The swap works! When trying to figure out what happens under
<i>call-by-reference</i>, it is often useful to draw pictures of the various
variables and their values and locations, then update them as the function
body executes.
</p>
<p>One can simulate <i>call-by-reference</i> in Scam by delaying the arguments
and capturing the calling environment.
To obtain the
calling environment in Scam,
one simply adds a formal parameter with the name <i>&#35;</i>.
The calling environment is then passed silently to the
function when a function call is made. This means that
the <i>&#35;</i> formal parameter is not matched to any actual argument
and can appear anywhere in the parameter list (except after
the variadic parameters <i>@</i> and <i>&#36;</i> - more on them later).
</p>
<p>In addition to grabbing a handle to the calling environment,
a swapping function also needs to delay the evaluation of
the variables passed in.
One delays the evaluation of an argument by naming the formal
parameter matched to the argument in a special way. If the
formal parameter name begins with a <i>&#36;</i>, then
the corresponding argument is delayed.
</p>
<p>With the ability to grab the calling environment,
delay the evaluation of arguments, and access the
bindings in an environment (see the chapter on Objects),
we can now define a <i>swap</i> function that works as intended.
</p>
<pre>
    (define (swap # $a $b)
        (define temp (get $a #))
        (set $a (get $b #) #)
        (set $b temp #)
        )
</pre>
<p>The <i>get</i> function takes a symbol and an environment and retrieves the
value of the symbol as found in the given environment.
The <i>set</i> function is analogous, but changes the value of a symbol
found in the given environment. Both <i>get</i> and <i>set</i> are true functions,
so the values of <i>&#36;a</i> and <i>&#36;b</i> are used in manipulating the given
environment. Note that this version of <i>swap</i> only works if variable
names (<i>i.e.</i> symbols) are
passed to <i>swap</i>.
</p>

<h2><a name="id3">Call-by-value-result</a></h2><p>
This method is a combination of the first two. Execution of the function
body proceeds as in <i>call</i>-by-value. That is, no updates of the actual
arguments are made. However, after execution of the body, but just before
the function returns, the actual arguments are updated with the final
values of their associated formal parameters. This method of parameter
passing is used for Ada <i>in-out</i> parameters.
</p>
<p>We can achieve the affect of
<i>call-by-value-result</i> in Scam by using a scheme 
similar
to the simulation of <i>call-by-reference</i>.
The modification is to
assigning the values of the passed symbols to local
variables at the start of the function:
</p>
<pre>
    (define (swap # $a $b)
        ; pre
        (define a (get $a #))
        (define b (get $b #))

        ; body
        (define temp a)
        (set! a b)
        (set! b temp)

        ;post
        (set $a a #)
        (set $b b #)
        )
</pre>
<p>The section marked <code>pre</code> sets up the locals while the section marked
<code>body</code> implements the swap on the locals. The section marked <code>post</code>
updates the variables that were passed to <i>swap</i>.
</p>
<p>Usually, one cannot tell whether a language implements
<i>call-by-reference</i> or <i>call-bay-value-result</i>;
the resulting values are the same.
One situation where the two methods of parameter passing can
generate different results is if the body portion of the
function references a global variable and that global
variable is passed as an argument as well. This second
reference to the global is known as an <i>alias</i>. Now there
are two references to the same variable through two different
names.
Unlike <i>call-by-value-result</i>,
updates to the alias in the body section
are immediately reflected in the value
of the global variable under <i>call-by-reference</i>.
</p>

<h2><a name="id4">Call-by-name</a></h2><p>
<i>Call-by-name</i> was used in Algol implementations. In essence, functions
are treated as macros. Under <i>call-by-name</i>, the fragment:
</p>
<pre>
    (define (swap a b)
        (define temp a)
        (set! a b)
        (set! b temp)
        )

    (define x 3)
    (define y 4)

    (swap x y)

    (println "x is "  x " and y is " y)
</pre>
<p>...would be translated into:
</p>
<pre>
    (define (swap a b)
        (define temp a)
        (set! a b)
        (set! b temp)
        )

    (define x 3)
    (define y 4)

    ;substitute the body of the function for the call, 
    ;renaming the references to formal parameters with the names of 
    ;the actual args

    (scope
        (define temp x)
        (assign x y)
        (assign y temp)
        )

    (println "x is "  x " and y is " y)
</pre>
<p>Under <i>call-by-name</i>, the <i>swap</i> works as desired,
so why is <i>call-by-name</i>
a method that has fallen into relative disuse? One reason is complexity.
What happens if a local parameter happens to have the same name as one of
the actual args. Suppose <i>swap</i> had been written as:
</p>
<pre>
    (define (swap a b)
        (define x a) 
        (set! a b)
        (set! b x)
        )
</pre>
<p>Then a naive substitution and renaming would have produced:
</p>
<pre>
    (scope
        (define x x)
        (assign x y)
        (assign y x)
        )
</pre>
<p>which is surely incorrect.
Further problems occur if the body of the function references
globals which have been shadowed in the calling function. This requires
a complicated renaming scheme. Finally, <i>call-by-name</i> makes treating
functions as first-class objects problematic (being difficult to recover
the static environment of the called function). <i>Call-by-name</i>
exists today in C++, where it is possible to <i>inline</i> function calls
for performance reasons, and in macro processors.
</p>

<h2><a name="id5">Call-by-need</a></h2><p>
In <i>call-by-value</i>, the arguments in a function call are evaluated and
the results are bound to the formal parameters of the function. In
<i>call-by-need</i>, the arguments themselves are literally bound
to the formal
parameters, as in <i>call-by-name</i>. A major difference is
that the calling environment is also bound to the formal
parameters as well. This bundle of literal argument and 
evaluation environment is known as a <i>thunk</i>.
The actual values of the arguments
are determined only when such values are
needed; when such a need occurs, the thunk is
evaluated, causing the literal argument
in the thunk to be
evaluated in the stored (calling) environment.
For example, consider this code:
</p>
<pre>
    (define (f x)
        (define y x)  ;x needed! x is fixed to its current value
        (set! z (* z 2))
        (+ x y)       ;x needed! x was already evaluated under call-by-need
        )
    (define z 5)
    (f (+ z 3)) 
</pre>
<p>Under <i>call-by-name</i>, the return value is 21, but under
<i>call-by-need</i>, the return value is 16.
This is because the
value of <i>z</i> changed <i>after</i> the point when the value of <i>x</i>
(really <code>(+ z 3)</code> was needed and the value of <i>x</i> was fixed from
the prior evaluation of <i>x</i>. Under <i>call-by-name</i>, the second
reference to <i>x</i> causes a fresh, new evaluation of <i>z</i>,
the yielding the result of 21.
</p>
<p><i>Call-by-need</i>
is exactly the method used to implement streams in the 
textbook
<i>The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</i>.
It is important to remember that the evaluation of a
<i>call-by-need</i> argument is done only once, 
with the result stored for future requests.
</p>
<p>One can simulate <i>call-by-need</i> in Scam by delaying the
evaluation of the arguments and capturing the calling
environment. The combination of delayed argument and
captured environment comprise a thunk in Scam. To memoize
the thunk, we assign the evaluation of the delayed argument
to a local variable. Here is a Scam's version of function <i>f</i>:
</p>
<pre>
    (define (f # $x)
        (define x (eval $x #))
        (set! z (* z 2))
        (+ x y)
        )
</pre>
<p>The built-in <i>eval</i> function is used to evaluate the thunk
comprised of <i>&#36;x</i> and &#35;.
</p>

<h2><a name="id6">Call-by-name-with-thunks</a></h2><p>
<i>Call-by-name-with-thunks</i> has roughly the same semantics
as <i>call-by-name</i>, the difference being
that thunks are used instead of textual substitutions.
in the body of the function. <i>Call-by-name-with-thunks</i> differs
from <i>call-by-need</i> in that the 
result of evaluating a thunk is not memoized (<i>i.e.</i> stored
for future retrieval). Instead, repeated
calls for the the value of the formal parameter result in the
expression in the thunk being evaluated again and again.
Differences between <i>call-by-need</i> and <i>call-by-name-with-thunks</i>
arise when the thunk's expression causes a change of state.
</p>
<pre>
    function f(x)
        {
        var y = x;    //x needed! Evaluate the arg in the calling env
        z = z * 2;
        return x + y; //x needed! Evaluate the arg in the calling env
        }

    var z = 5;
    f(z + 3);
</pre>
<p>Like <i>call-by-name</i>, this function call also returns 21. One can simulate
<i>call-by-name-with-thunks</i> in Scam easily:
</p>
<pre>
    (define (f # $x)
        (define y (eval $x #))
        (set! z (* z 2))
        (+ (eval $x #) y)
        )
</pre>
<p>Here, any time the value of the delayed argument is needed, a fresh
evaluation is invoked.
</p>

<h2><a name="id7">Variadic functions</a></h2><p>
A variadic function is a function that can take a different
number of arguments from call to call.
Scam allows this via two special formal parameter names.
They are <i>@</i> and <i>&#36;</i>.
If the last formal parameter is <i>@</i>, then all remaining
(evaluated) arguments not matched to any previous formal
parameters are gathered up in a list and the variable <i>@</i> is bound to this
list.  For example, consider these definitions:
</p>
<pre>
    (define (variadic first @)
        (println "the first argument is " first)
        (println "the remaining arguments are:")
        (while (valid? @)
            (println "    " (car @))
            (set! @ (cdr @))
            )
        )
    (define x 1)
    (define y 2)
</pre>
<p>The call <code>(variadic x)</code> produces:
</p>
<pre>
    the first argument is 1
    the remaining arguments are:
</pre>
<p>while the call <code>(variadic x y (+ x y))</code> produces:
</p>
<pre>
    the first argument is 1
    the remaining arguments are:
         2
         3
</pre>
<p>Similar to <i>@,</i> the formal parameter <i>&#36;</i> is expected to be the
last formal parameter. The difference is that the arguments
bundled up into a list
are delayed. Suppose one replaced all occurrences of <i>@</i> with
<i>&#36;</i> in the definition of <i>variadic</i>.
Then, the call <code>(variadic x y (+ x y))</code> would produce:
</p>
<pre>
    the first argument is x
    the remaining arguments are:
        y
        (+ x y)
</pre>
