<h1><a name="id2">Description</a></h1><p>
This is a special class in human-assisted, computer
generated music. We will explore the art of
synthesizing music from sets of instrument
samples. In addition to the music you program,
you will be adding vocals 
with a 
state-of-the-art 24 bit/96kHz professional
recording system.

<h1><a name="id4">The Computer School of Rock</a></h1><p>
The <i>Computer School of Rock</i>
is a hands-on course for Computer Scientists
with a little bit of musical
ability. You will start small, programming
some simple drum lines and guitar riffs.
Eventually, you will use these results to
compose a full-fledged songs. Each student
will be in charge of producing three songs,
You may barter your skills with
other students. For example, suppose you
become proficient at drum programming.
A good drummer is very hard to find so
your skills will be in great demand. You
might compose the drum line for another
student's song in exchange for lyrics
or harmonies for your song. Or you may
choose to compose, program, and sing/speak
your song alone.
The choice on how you produce your song
is up to you.
</p>
<p>Nearly all the software used to
produce your music has
been written by previous participants in
this class. In addition to your
music composition/programming tasks,
you might wish to augment the <i>songlib</i> software
in some important way.  You may also record instrument samples
for placement in the <i>songlib</i> free sound
repository.
</p>
<p>The following talents will be needed for the
course:
</p>
<ul><li>programming skills
</li><li>song writing ability (lyrics and/or score)
</li><li>singing/speaking ability
</li><li>a good musical ear
</li><li>a desire to rock
</li><li>a realization that it's a long way to the top
</li></ul>
<p>Note that the ability to play an instrument or read
music is not strictly necessary (but it will help).
