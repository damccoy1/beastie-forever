<h2> Introduction
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

This document concerns the teaching of C as a first language
in a CS1 course. As it is often the desire to include the
ideas of object encapsulation in a first course, C should be
taught in a style that emphasizes encapsulation. Students
who learn this style should have little trouble in moving
to an object-oriented language later, especially if the
advanced ideas (last section) are taught.
<br/>
<br/>
The remainder of this document assumes a familiarity with
C and some object oriented language.
<br/>
<!-- section -->
<h2> The basic idea
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

Instructors should always stress the object oriented nature of the program,
emphasizing that each
class gets its own module. In general, the public interface of a class
<i>X</i> is placed in a file named <i>X.h</i>, often
called a <i>header file</i>.
The public interface consists of the structure that
encapsulates the components of the class and
the prototypes of the public functions (methods) that
(typically) operate upon the structure. The public interface
also includes external declarations of any components that
are shared between objects of a class.
The implementation of the
class <i>X</i> is placed in a file named <i>X.c</i>.
The implementation consists of the function definitions
and variable declarations that were mentioned in the
public interface along with definitions and declarations
that are private (i.e., not visible outside the class).
<br/>
<!-- section -->
<h2> An example class declaration
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

Here is the public interface for a <i>NODE</i> class, which can
be used to make a linked list. The public interface
is stored in a file named <i>node.h</i>:
<br/>

<pre>
    #ifndef __NODE_INCLUDED__
    #define __NODE_INCLUDED__

    typedef struct node NODE; /* forward declaration of our structure */

    extern char *INTEGER;
    extern char *REAL;
    extern char *STRING;

    extern NODE  *newNODEinteger(int value,NODE *next);
    extern NODE  *newNODEreal(double value,NODE *next);
    extern NODE  *newNODEstring(char *value,NODE *next);
    extern char  *getNODEtype(NODE *n);
    extern int    getNODEinteger(NODE *n);
    extern double getNODEreal(NODE *n);
    extern char  *getNODEstring(NODE *n);
    extern NODE  *getNODEnext(NODE *n);

    #endif
</pre>

We can have three kinds of nodes, one that stores an
integer value, one that stores a real value, and
one that stores a string value.
<br/>
<br/>
We also declare external the three character constants to populate
the <i>type</i> field, so we know what kind of node we have.
Note that it is not necessary to explicitly declare the methods
of the class external, but we do so, so that the instance variables
and the method prototypes look consistent in
the <i>.h</i> file.
<br/>
<br/>
The public interface exposes three node creating functions,
named <i>newX</i>,
depending on what kind of node you would like to create. It
also exposes the access functions, named <i>getX</i>, to retrieve
the various instance variables of the node.
You may also have mutators, usually named <i>setX</i>;
this example has no need of mutators, however.
<br/>
<br/>
The implementation, which should be stored in a file
named <i>node</i>.<i>c</i>, looks like this:
<br/>

<pre>
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
    #include &quot;node.h&quot;

    struct node
        {
        char *type;
        int ival;
        double rval;    /* ival, rval, sval: one will hold the actual value */
        char *sval;
        NODE *next;
        };

    static NODE *newNODE(void);

    /*************** public interface *************/

    char *INTEGER = &quot;integer&quot;;
    char *REAL = &quot;real&quot;;
    char *STRING = &quot;string&quot;;

    /* constructors */

    NODE *
    newNODEinteger(int v,NODE *n)
        {
        NODE *p = newNODE();
        p-&gt;type = INTEGER;
        p-&gt;ival = v;
        p-&gt;next = n;
        return p;
        }

    NODE *
    newNODEreal(double v,NODE *n)
        {
        NODE *p = newNODE();
        p-&gt;type = REAL;
        p-&gt;rval = v;
        p-&gt;next = n;
        return p;
        }

    NODE *
    newNODEstring(char *v,NODE *n)
        {
        NODE *p = newNODE();
        p-&gt;type = STRING;
        p-&gt;sval = v;
        p-&gt;next = n;
        return p;
        }

    /* accessors */

    char  *getNODEtype(NODE *n)    { return n-&gt;type; }
    int    getNODEinteger(NODE *n) { return n-&gt;ival; }
    double getNODEreal(NODE *n)    { return n-&gt;rval; }
    char  *getNODEstring(NODE *n)  { return n-&gt;sval; }
    NODE  *getNODEnext(NODE *n)    { return n-&gt;next; }

    /*************** private methods *************/

    static NODE *
    newNODE()
        {
        NODE *n = (NODE *) malloc(sizeof(NODE));
        if (n == 0) { fprintf(stderr,&quot;out of memory&quot;); exit(-1); }
        return n;
        }
</pre>

We can see from the implementation that our node structure has
separate fields for each of the types our node can store.
We could use a
union to save some space, but these days of lots of
memory, it's hardly worth the trouble.
<br/>
<br/>
We can now make and manipulate nodes:
<br/>

<pre>
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    #include &quot;node.h&quot;

    int
    main()
        {
        NODE *n;

        n = newNODEinteger(3,0); /* zero is the null pointer */
        n = newNODEreal(5.5,n);
        n = newNODEstring(&quot;hello&quot;,n);

        while (n != 0)
            {
            char *t = getNODEtype(n);
            if (t == INTEGER)
                printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;,getNODEinteger(n));
            else if (t == REAL)
                printf(&quot;%f\n&quot;,getNODEreal(n));
            else if (t == STRING)
                printf(&quot;%s\n&quot;,getNODEstring(n));

            n = getNODEnext(n);
            }

        return 0;
        }
</pre>

<br/>
<br/>
Compile <i>nodetest</i> with the command:
<br/>

<pre>
    gcc -Wall -Wextra nodetest.c node.c -o nodetest
</pre>

<!-- section -->
<h2> A more complicated example
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

The <i>X.h</i> file contains the forward definition of the
typedef-ed structure
representing class X as well as the prototypes for all the public
methods. Consider a <i>STUDENT</i> class which holds the ID number
of a student, a list of the classes he or she is currently taking,
a list of past classes, and the student's cumulative gpa.
The file named <i>student.h</i>, might
look like:
<br/>

<pre>
    #ifndef __STUDENT_INCLUDED__
    #define __STUDENT_INCLUDED__

    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    #include &quot;class.h&quot;

    typedef struct student STUDENT;

    extern STUDENT *newSTUDENT(int id);
    extern void addSTUDENTclass(STUDENT *s, CLASS *c,int grade);
    extern void setSTUDENTgrade(STUDENT *s, CLASS *c,int grade);
    extern void setSTUDENTgpa(STUDENT *s, FILE *where);
    extern void displaySTUDENT(STUDENT *s, FILE *where);

    #endif
</pre>

Note the typedef that gives a simple name to a <i>student</i> structure/object.
Note also that <i>STUDENT</i> references another class named <i>CLASS</i>.
<br/>
<br/>
Public methods for a class follow a naming convention. For example, an
insert method for objects of class <i>X</i> would be named <i>insertX</i>.
Another convention is that the first argument for a class method is always
the object.
<br/>
<!-- section -->
<h2> Public versus private
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

Students should be well versed in the use of the keywords
{tt static} and {tt extern}
for controlling the visibility of definitions
and declarations.
Public components that are shared by all objects in a class are declared in
the associated <i>.c</i> file.
For example, suppose a shared component is the
total number of students.
This would be declared as a global in the <i>.c</i>
file as:
<br/>

<pre>
    int NumberOfStudents = 0;
</pre>

if it is a public shared attribute. These public, shared
components are also
re-declared extern in the <i>.h</i> file, as in:
<br/>

<pre>
    extern int NumberOfStudents;
</pre>

If the component is to be shared, but made private,
it would be declared static in the implementation file, as in:
<br/>

<pre>
    static int NumberOfGoodStudents;
</pre>

and would not appear in the header file.
<br/>
<br/>
Private methods
in the implementation are placed in the <i>.c</i>
file but are declared static.
<br/>
<!-- section -->
<h2> Constructors
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

The constructor for a class <i>X</i> is named <i>newX</i>,
by convention. It
allocates space for the object and then initializes the components of
the object. For example, if the student structure looked like:
<br/>

<pre>
    struct student
        {
        int id;
        CLASS **currentClasses;
        int currentClasseCount;
        CLASS **pastClasses;
        int pastClassCount;
        double gpa;
        };
</pre>

the constructor <i>newSTUDENT</i> might look like:
<br/>

<pre>
    STUDENT *
    newSTUDENT(int id)
        {
        STUDENT *p;

        /* allocate the object */

        p = (STUDENT *) malloc (sizeof(STUDENT));

        if (p == 0) Error(&quot;Allocating a STUDENT: out of memory&quot;);

        /* initialize components */

        p-&gt;id = id;
        p-&gt;currentClasses = 0;
        p-&gt;currentClassCount = 0;
        p-&gt;pastClasses = 0;
        p-&gt;pastClassCount = 0;
        p-&gt;gpa = 0.0;

        ++NumberOfStudents;

        return p;
        }
</pre>

Multiple constructors require unique names.
By convention, constructors
for class <i>X</i> would all have the form <i>newXalpha</i>,
where <i>alpha</i> is either empty
or a description that distinguishes the constructor from the other
constructors.
<br/>
<!-- section -->
<h2> Encapsulating methods
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

It is easy enough for an object to &ldquo;carry along&rdquo; methods as function
pointers, relieving the programmer from coming up with unique names for
public methods. This is probably too much for a first semester course,
however. Also, realize that the object must still be passed to these
methods so that the object's components are all accessible.
<br/>
<br/>
Here is the <i>STUDENT</i> structure rewritten in such a style:
<br/>

<pre>
    #include &quot;student.h&quot;

    struct student
        {
        /* components */
        int id;
        CLASS **currentClasses;
        int currentClassCount;
        CLASS **pastClasses;
        int pastClassCount;
        double gpa;

        /* pointer to methods */
        void (*addClass)(STUDENT *s,Class *c,int grade);
        void (*setGrad)(STUDENT *s,Class *c,int grade);
        void (*setGPA)(STUDENT *s,FILE *);
        void (*display)STUDENT *s,FILE *);
        }

    extern STUDENT *newSTUDENT(int id);
</pre>

The constructor for <i>STUDENT</i> sets the function pointers in the methods
section of the typedef:
<br/>

<pre>
    STUDENT *
    newSTUDENT(int id)
        {
        STUDENT *p;

        /* allocate the object */

        p = (STUDENT *) malloc (sizeof(STUDENT));

        if (p == 0) Error(&quot;Allocating a STUDENT: out of memory&quot;);

        /* initialize components */

        p-&gt;id = id;
        p-&gt;currentClasses = 0;
        p-&gt;currentClassCount = 0;
        p-&gt;pastClasses = 0;
        p-&gt;pastClassCount = 0;
        p-&gt;gpa = 0.0;

        /* set the methods */

        p-&gt;addClass = addClass;
        p-&gt;addGrade = addGrade;
        p-&gt;setGPA = setGPA;
        p-&gt;display = display;

        ++NumberOfStudents;

        return p;
        }
</pre>

The methods <i>addClass</i>, <i>addGrade</i>,
<i>setGPA</i>, and <i>display</i>
are defined with the static keyword (making them private)
in <i>student.h</i>.
<br/>
<br/>
Here is an example call to the <i>display</i> method:
<br/>

<pre>
    STUDENT *s;

    s = newSTUDENT(123456789);
    /* add past classes */
    ...
    s-&gt;setGPA(s,&quot;transcript&quot;);
    s-&gt;display(s,stdout);
</pre>

Even when encapsulating methods, one still needs to pass the object
itself to the method.
<br/>
<!-- section -->
<h2>Inheritance
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

As inheritance is not allowed, code reuse is accomplished via wrapper
functions that dispatch to clients. Instead of a class <i>X</i> inheriting
from class <i>Y</i>,
an object of type <i>X</i> instead has a component which holds
a pointer to an object of type <i>Y</i>.
Suppose inserting into an <i>X</i> object is
really an insertion into the <i>Y</i> object.
If so, the solution is to define a function <i>insertX</i>
that simply calls <i>insertY</i> on object component <i>Y</i>.
<br/>
<!-- section -->
<h2> Advanced ideas
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

In the above scenario, all of the components of an object are
private, but the
object itself is exposed and can be manipulated outside of the
public interface.
If the object itself must be private, then the constructors
are reformulated to
return an index into a private array of objects (similar to the <i>open</i>
constructor for file descriptor objects). The object is now an integer
rather than a pointer to a structure.
The <i>newSTUDENT</i> constructor, in this case, might
look like:
<br/>

<pre>
    int
    newSTUDENT(int id)
        {
        STUDENT *p;

        ++NumberOfStudents;

        p = (STUDENT *) malloc (sizeof(STUDENT));

        if (p == 0) Error(&quot;out of memory&quot;);

        p-&gt;id = id;
        p-&gt;currentClasses = 0;
        p-&gt;currentClassCount = 0;
        p-&gt;pastClasses = 0;
        p-&gt;pastClassCount = 0;
        p-&gt;gpa = 0.0;

        return add(p);
        }
</pre>

The <i>add</i> function resizes the array holding the allocated <i>STUDENT</i>
objects to make room for the new object and returns the index
corresponding to where the new object was placed:
<br/>

<pre>
    static int
    add(STUDENT *p)
        {
        /* increase the number of students */

        ++NumberOfStudents;

        /* reallocate where the object is stored */

        Students = (STUDENT **) realloc(Students * sizeof(STUDENT *) 
            * NumberOfStudents);

        if (Students == 0) Error(&quot;out of memory&quot;);

        /* store the student object and return its index */

        Students[NumberOfStudents - 1] = p;
        return NumberOfStudents - 1;
        }
</pre>

The <i>Student</i> array is also
declared static in the <i>student.c</i>
file:
<br/>

<pre>
    static STUDENT **Students = 0;
</pre>

Of course, the <i>add</i> routine should use
array size doubling if a large amount of objects
are to be allocated.
<br/>
<br/>
The downside to privatizing the components is that type checking on the
first argument to class methods (the object argument) is weakened since
the first argument is now an integer index. Also, there is no protection
against arbitrarily generating Student indices. One can mitigate this
latter concern by having the constructor return
long integer keys that map to actual internal indices. A red-black tree
can store the mapping between keys and actual indices.
