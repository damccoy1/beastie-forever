<h2>
 Object-orientation

<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

Here is one way to achieve one of the hallmarks of object-orientation,
<i>encapsulation</i>.
The idea is to use the first class nature of functions to provide a wrapper
for data and a means for penetrating that wrapper. For example, a constructor
for rational numbers in this paradigm might look like:
<br/>

<pre>
    (define (Rational numerator denominator)
        ; the formal parameters numerator and denominator are the members
        ; member functions / selectors go here
        (define type &#39;Rational)
            (define (convert object)
                (cond
                    ((number? object)(Rational object 1))
                    (else &#39;())
                    )
                )
        (define (show)
            (display numerator) (display &quot;/&quot;) (display denominator)
            )
        (define (add b)
            (Rational
               (+ (* numerator (b &#39;denominator)) (* (b &#39;numerator) denominator))
                  (* denominator (b &#39;denominator))
                  )
            )
        ; function which handles components / selectors / member functions
        ; is returned here
        (define (rat msg . args)
            (cond
                ((eq? msg &#39;numerator) numerator)
                ((eq? msg &#39;denominator) denominator)
                ((eq? msg &#39;convert) (convert (car args)))
                ((eq? msg &#39;add) (add (car args)))
                ((eq? msg &#39;type) &#39;Rational)
                ((eq? msg &#39;show) show)
                )
            )
        rat
        )
</pre>

Consider the following definition:
<br/>

<pre>
    (define a (Rational 3 4))
</pre>

If we wish to select the numerator, we simply type the expression:
<br/>

<pre>
    (a &#39;numerator)
</pre>

To select the denominator, we type
<br/>

<pre>
    (a &#39;denominator)
</pre>

To show <i>a</i>,
we need to recall that the &ldqo;object&rdquo; will return the function
show; to execute it, we need to evaluate that function
like so:
<br/>

<pre>
    ((a &#39;show))
</pre>

<h2>
 Generic operators and object orientation
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

The
<a href="http://beastie.cs.ua.edu/proglan/datadriv.html">data-driven approach</a>
is one method for writing
generic procedures. But rather than installing functions into a table,
let's take an object-oriented approach in which the objects carry along
their functions with them. Let's look at the operator +. Can we write a
generic form of + which not only adds numbers but adds objects (like Rationals
and Complexes) as well? Try it! <b><i>Hint: don't use get and put - don't
use the table method at all!</i></b>
<br/>
<br/>
To begin, we save the original version of 
<code>+</code>:
<br/>

<pre>
    (define basic-plus +)
</pre>

Then we need to write an oveload of 
<code>+</code> so that it calls the add function
for &ldquo;objects&rdquo;.
<br/>

<pre>
    (define (+ a b)
        (cond
            ((and (number? a) (number? b))
                (basic-plus a b))
            ((number? a) ; b must be an object
                (b &#39;add (b &#39;convert a)))
            ((number? b)
                (a &#39;add (a &#39;convert b)))
            ((eq? (a &#39;type) (b &#39;type))
                (a &#39;add b))
            ((a&#39;convert b)
                (a &#39;add (a&#39;convert b)))
            ((a&#39;convert b)
                (a &#39;add (a&#39;convert b)))
            )
        )
</pre>

Note that the convert function is used to coerce unlike objects to the
same type. As long as every &ldquo;class&rdquo; that wishes to overload 
<code>+</code> supplies
appropriate <i>add</i> and <i>convert</i> functions, then our redefinition
of 
<code>+</code> is completely general (at least for two arguments). The drawback
is that every class has to know about every other class. When adding a
new type of number, every other class needs modification, adding the appropriate
clauses to the add and convert routines. A better way uses a
<a href="href=http://beastie.cs.ua.edu/proglan/datadriv.htm">
data driven approach
</a>. In this approach adding a new type requires no modification
of the existing types.
<br/>
<br/>
Note also that the &ldquo;members&rdquo; of a Rational object are complete walled
off from the rest of the world. The only way to access them is through
the &ldquo;access functions&rdquo;. We have thus provided the first leg of the object
oriented paradigm, encapsulation. We'll look at the other two legs, polymorphism
and inheritance, later.
