<h2> Preliminary information
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

Your task is to build an interpreter for a general purpose programming language
of your own design. Your language must support the following features:
<br/>

<ul>

<li>

 comments
</li>

<li>

 integers and strings
</li>

<li>

 dynamically typed (like Scheme and Python)
</li>

<li>

 arrays with O(1) access time
</li>

<li>

 conditionals
</li>

<li>

 recursion
</li>

<li>

 iteration
</li>

<li>

 convenient means to print to the console
</li>

<li>

 an adequate set of operators
</li>

<li>

 anonymous functions
</li>

<li>

 functions as first-class objects
(i.e. functions can be manipulated as in Scheme - e.g. local functions)
</li>

<li>

 (graduate only) strong typing (type errors detected at parse time)
</li>

</ul>


The only basic types you need to provide are integer and string and you do
not need to provide methods for coercing one type to another (although you
may find it convenient to do so).
The efficiency of your interpreter is not
particularly important,
as long as you can solve the test problem in a reasonable
amount of time.
Your language also does not need to support reclamation of
memory that is no longer needed.
You are to write your program in a statically-typed, imperative language
such as C, C++, or Java.
Check with me first if you wish to use some other host language.
<br/>
<!-- section -->
<h2> Test Problem
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

You are to write a program to implement the Sieve of Eratosthenes,
starting with a (potentially) infinite stream of numbers.
Provide a README file that explains how to run and test your
program. Your program should not use assignment.
<br/>
<br/>
You will receive a serious deduction if any
rule in your makefile causes a pause for input.
<br/>
<!-- section -->
<h2> Grading
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->


<ul>

<li>

 [100 points] everything works
</li>

<li>

 [51-99 points] functionality is missing/test program is missing
</li>

<li>

 [50 points] pretty printing
</li>

<li>

 [30 points] recognizing
</li>

</ul>


Extra credit will be given to exceptional implementations.
Your README file should give pertinent details.
<br/>
<br/>
<i>For Undergraduates</i>:
if you do not, at least, implement a recognizer
for your language, you will fail the course.
<br/>
<br/>
<i>For Graduates</i>:
if you do not, at least, implement an pretty printer,
you will fail the course.

<h2> Submitting the assignment
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

To submit your designer programming language,
place all your source code,
sample programs, a README detailing how to run and write programs
in your language, and a makefile for building your system
into one directory.
Name the README file <i>README</i>.
Your makefile should respond the command
<br/>

<pre>
    make
</pre>

which builds your processor and to the following commands,
each of which illustrates a feature of your language:
<br/>

<pre>
    make error1
    make error1x
    make error2
    make error2x
    make error3
    make error3x
    make error4
    make error4x
    make error5
    make error5x
    make arrays
    make arraysx
    make conditionals
    make conditionalsx
    make recursion
    make recursionx
    make iteration
    make iterationx
    make functions
    make functionsx      # shows you can pass functions and return nested functions
    make lambda      
    make lambdax      
    make dictionary
    make dictionaryx     # shows that you have a log(n) AVL-tree dictionary
</pre>

The first rule in a pair of rules should print
out the appropriate input program,
while the <i>x</i> rules should execute that program.
In particular, the first three error rules should show off your parser detecting
three different kinds of syntax errors,
while the last to error rules should demonstrate the detection of
two different kinds of semantic errors.
<br/>
<br/>
Your makefile
should also respond to the commands:
<br/>

<pre>
    make problem
    make problemx
</pre>

These commands display the test problem of your implementation
and run the test problem, respectively.
<br/>
<br/>
Finally, provide an executable shellscript named <i>dpl</i> that runs a program
like so:

<pre>
    dpl testprogram1.mylang
</pre>

Test programs can be named anything.
<br/>
<br/>
Note: in the case of recognizing only, only the error rules need
be present in your makefile. In the case of pretty printing only,
the <i>run</i> rules
should run the input program through the pretty printer.
<br/>
<br/>
Finally, your makefile
should respond to the command:
<br/>

<pre>
    make clean
</pre>

This command should remove all compilation artifacts
(such as 
<code>.o</code> or 
<code>.class</code> files)
so that a clean compile can be performed.
<br/>
<br/>
Makefiles for graduate students should additionally respond to the commands:
<br/>

<pre>
    make grad
    make gradx
</pre>

These rules should thoroughly demonstrate the additional requirements for
graduate students.
<br/>
<br/>
To submit your language interpreter, run the command:
<br/>

<pre>
    submit proglan lusth dpl
</pre>
