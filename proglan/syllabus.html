<h2> Catalog Statement
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

Formal study of programming language specification, analysis,
implementation, and run-time support structures; organization of
programming languages with emphasis on language constructs and mechanisms;
and study of non-procedural programming paradigms.
<br/>
<!-- section -->
<h2> Implementing the Catalog Statement
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

Students will embed
features from various languages into Scam, a lexically-scoped variant
of LISP. Students will also individually implement a programming
language of their own design and write a significant program
demonstrating the language.
<br/>
<br/>
Additional and orthogonal subjects to be covered in this class
are:
<i>lexical analysis</i>,
<i>syntactical analysis</i>,
<i>parameter passing strategies</i>, and
<i>axiomatic semantics</i>.
<br/>
<br/>
At the end of this class, a student should be understand the concepts
of:
<i>syntax vs. semantics</i>,
<i>data vs. procedures</i>,
<i>objects and state</i>,
<i>functional programming</i>,
<i>evaluation strategies</i>, and
<i>interpretation vs. compilation</i>.

CS200 and CS201 (soon to be CS300 and CS301)

<h2> Textbook and Supplies
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

Ableson and Sussman,
<i>The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</i>,

<br/>
<br/>
A Linux-based laptop computer is required for this course.
A Windows-10 installation that includes bash is acceptable.
A Mac installation is possible with some work.
<br/>
<!-- section -->
<h2> Larger Issues
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

This class is not only concerned with what you learn. but how
fast you learn. The only way to learn quickly is read in advance,
take your study group seriously,
ask copious questions,
and start
all programming tasks early.
<br/>
<!-- section -->
<h2> Topics
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

The reading schedule can be found at:
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="indent">
<a href="http://beastie.cs.ua.edu/proglan/schedule.html" style="font-size:10px,font-family:'Lucida Console',monospace">http://beastie.cs.ua.edu/proglan/schedule.html</a>
</span>

<br/>
Make sure you read the assigned material, work any exercises, and
explore answering any questions prior to class.
<br/>
<!-- section -->
<h2> Attendance
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

Attendance is not required. If you miss, you are expected to get
any missing information from other members of the class, especially your
study group. I will not tell you what you've missed as I am too lazy to
lecture over the same material more than once.
<br/>
<br/>
An absence will be excused if
you
provide a written, university authorized, excuse.
<br/>
<!-- section -->
<h2> Grading
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

Grades will be determined by the following percentages:
<br/>
<span class="indent">
<table>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left";> 10% </td><td style="text-align:left";> Prerequisite Exam </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left";> 30% </td><td style="text-align:left";> Periodic Concept Exams (2) </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left";> 20% </td><td style="text-align:left";> Final Exam </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left";> 20% </td><td style="text-align:left";> Large programming assignment </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left";> 20% </td><td style="text-align:left";> Small programming assignments (3) </td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2> Grading Methodology
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

The Prerequisite Exam is a multiple choice test consisting of
questions that will be somewhat randomly selected from the
set of questions found at:
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="indent">
<a href="http://beastie.cs.ua.edu/concepts/cs/ds/all.html" style="font-size:10px,font-family:'Lucida Console',monospace">http://beastie.cs.ua.edu/concepts/cs/ds/all.html</a>
</span>

<br/>
Note that selected questions may be randomly tweaked.
<br/>
<br/>
For all programming assignments,
you must pass all tests. If you fail even one test, you will have to
resubmit. You are allowed three resubmissions, with each resubmission
resulting in 8, 12, and 16 point deductions respectively.
If you cannot pass all tests
after your third resubmission, you will receive a score of 25% if
you can pass a majority of the tests.
Otherwise, you will receive a zero.
<br/>
<br/>
For your designer programming language,
you should implement the following support modules in the order given:
<br/>

<ul>

<li>

 Grammar
</li>

<li>

 Lexical Analyzer
</li>

<li>

 Parser
</li>

<li>

 Environment
</li>

</ul>


The
milestones
for having these support modules completed
are found in the schedule.
<br/>
<br/>
Your final project must have a certain level of functionality
(given in the project description).
Otherwise, you will receive a failing grade
for the class.
<br/>
<br/>
Grading is straight scale with the following cut-offs: 90% and above
is an A, 80% and above is a B, 70% and above is a C, 60% and above is a
D, and anything lower than 60% is an F. These cut-offs are strict. For
example, 79.99999% is a C.
The delta for plus-minus is two points.
For example, 90..92 will be an A-, while 98..100 will be an A+.
<br/>
<br/>
Undergraduate students will be able to omit a certain number of
questions on exams. Graduate students will not be able to omit
any questions.
<br/>
<br/>

<h2> Other Details
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

The following conventions will be followed in
<i>Programming Languages</i>. Please make sure
that you fully understand each of the items listed below.
<br/>

<ul>

<li>

 Attendance is
not required. However, I generally
will not answer questions that I have already
answered in class. Use the forum (see below) to ask questions about
material you missed from being absent.

<br/>
<br/>

</li>

<li>

 There are no make-up exams (unless you have
a written, university-authorized excuse).
If you miss an exam,
a zero will be recorded for your score.
You have two weeks from the day a test is returned to
contest its scoring.

<br/>
<br/>

</li>

<li>

 Please be in your seat by the beginning of class. There is to be no
food or drink in the classroom. Sleep is allowed only in the event of a
stultifyingly boring lecture.

<br/>
<br/>

</li>

<li>

 Signing up for and keeping current with the <i>Programming Languages</i> Forum at
<a href="http://beastie.cs.ua.edu/mybb" style="font-size:10px,font-family:'Lucida Console',monospace">http://beastie.cs.ua.edu/mybb</a>
is mandatory.
Schedule changes, assignment clarifications, and such will be announced
via the forum.

<br/>
<br/>

</li>

<li>

 Programming assignments are to be submitted electronically by 4:59:59 p.m.
on the day they are due.
For these projects,
there is a grace period: late projects will be
accepted up to 48 hours after the due date with no penalty.
<i>Please do not ask for an
extension as I will most assuredly say no and then we'll both end up
feeling bad</i>.

<br/>
<br/>

</li>

<li>

 Each assignment is to be done individually.
There can be no sharing of code or solutions.

<br/>
<br/>

</li>

<li>

 The University of Alabama Code of Academic Conduct
will be rigorously enforced.
Please review the code at
<a href="http://www.studenthandbook.ua.edu/academicintegritypolicies.html" style="font-size:10px,font-family:'Lucida Console',monospace">http://www.studenthandbook.ua.edu/academicintegritypolicies.html</a>
and be sure to follow this Code in all activities associated with CS403/CS503.
Any violations of this code will be handled as an Academic Misconduct case.
The minimum punishment requested for plagiarism,
or any other academic misconduct, is
dismissal from the class with a failing grade. You are required to
protect your work from plagiarism. If your work is plagiarized, it will
be assumed that you were a willing participant in the plagiarism and
you will receive the same punishment as the plagiarist, absent extraordinary
evidence to the contrary.
