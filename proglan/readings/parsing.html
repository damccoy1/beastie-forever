<h2> Parse trees
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

We have previously seen that most programming language grammars
can be transformed into a <i>recognizer</i> via recursive descent.
While a recognizer performs a useful task, detecting syntactic
errors in the source code, its utility can be greatly enhanced
by assembling matched lexemes into structures that abstract
the original source. Such abstract structures are called <i>parse trees</i>.
<br/>
<br/>
Consider the implementation of the following right recursive grammar
as a recognizer:
<br/>

<pre>
    expression : unary op expression | unary

    op : PLUS | MINUS | TIMES | DIVIDE

    unary : VARIABLE | NUMBER | OPAREN expression CPAREN | MINUS unary
</pre>

The function corresponding to <i>expression</i> becomes:
<br/>

<pre>
    function expression()
        {
        unary();
        if (opPending())
            {
            op();
            expression();
            }
        }
</pre>

Note that while the <i>expression</i> function
enforces the proper structure of an expression,
it does not save the lexed source code;
all the lexemes are thrown away. In order
to save the lexemes and to combine into a structure representative of
the input, we will now take advantage of the fact that <i>match</i>
returns lexemes.
We will convert all of the
recursive descent functions to return the structure that function has
recognized, in the form of a tree of lexemes.
We also make sure
the tree being built is tagged with the kind of structure that
was recognized. We do this by using a special lexeme as the
root of the tree.
<br/>
<br/>
It is assumed the lexeme
objects are outfitted with left and right pointers so that they can be
assembled into binary trees. Here is the updated <i>expression</i> function.
<br/>

<pre>
    function expression()
        {
        var u;

        u = unary();
        if (opPending()) //a binary expression
            {
            var tree = new Lexeme(BINARY); //this is the tag
            tree.left = op();
            tree.right = new Lexeme(GLUE); //an interior node
            tree.right.left = u;
            tree.right.right = expression();
            return tree;
            }
        else //a unary expression
            return u;
        }
</pre>

Note that the calls to non-terminals and pending functions are preserved
in exactly the same order as before.
Now, however,
the <i>expression</i> function returns a tree whose root, in the case of a
complex expression, is a
lexeme of type 
<code>BINARY</code>
and whose left and right subtrees hold
the operator and the operands
of the expression,
respectively. In the case of a simple expression (<i>unary</i> only), the
tree returned by the <i>unary</i> function is returned. The <i>op</i> and
<i>unary</i> routines become:
<br/>

<pre>
    function op()
        {
        var tree;
        //the tree is the operator that was found
        if (check(PLUS)) tree = advance();
        else if (check(MINUS)) tree = advance();
        ...
        else if (check(ASSIGN)) tree = advance();
        ...
        else if (check(LESS_THAN)) tree = advance();
        else tree = match(LESS_THAN_OR_EQUAL);

        return tree;
        }
</pre>


<pre>
    function unary() 
        {
        var tree;

        if (check(VARIABLE)) tree = advance();
        else if (check(INTEGER)) tree = advance();
        else if (check(OPAREN))
            {
            tree = match(OPAREN); //tree is tagged OPAREN
            tree.left = null;
            tree.right = expression();
            }
        else //unary minus
            {
            match(MINUS);
            tree = new Lexeme(UMINUS); //tag the tree
            tree.left = null;
            tree.right = unary();
            }

        return tree;
        }
</pre>

Note that the lexeme type in the unary minus case was renamed to reflect
that the binary MINUS sign was overloaded at the lexical level.
In general, a parsing function has the flow-of-control as the associated
recognizing function, but returns a parse tree assembled from
the <i>good stuff</i> in the source code. Usually, the <i>good</i> stuff is
the minimal set of lexemes needed to reconstruct the source. For example,
consider a function definition:
<br/>

<pre>
    functionDef : FUNCTION VARIABLE OPEN_PAREN parameterList CLOSE_PAREN block
</pre>

As a parsing function, a reasonable implementation of <i>functionDef</i>
would be:
<br/>

<pre>
    function functionDef()
        {
        var tree;
        tree = match(FUNCTION);             //tag the tree
        tree.left = match(VARIABLE);
        match(OPEN_PAREN);                  //no need to save
        tree.right = new Lexeme(GLUE);
        tree.right.left = optParameterList();
        match(CLOSE_PAREN);                 //no need to save
        tree.right.right = block();
        return tree;
        }
</pre>

Note that the parentheses enclosing the parameter list were not saved
in the tree that was returned. This is because the original definition
in the source code can be recreated with the parts that were saved.
Punctuation is usually not preserved in parse trees.
<br/>
<br/>
Once the recognizer is completely converted to a parser, the top-level
rule (the first rule called) returns a parse tree that represents the
entire source code program. This is not the only way to handle parse
trees, but it is the simplest way.
<br/>
<br/>
One converts a recognizer to a parser by ensuring
every recursive descent function returns a parse tree. The shape of
the parse tree is irrelevant, as long as the important lexemes are
stored in the tree.
It is important for a function that builds a parse tree to
tag the tree it returns with some indication of what the
tree represents.
<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, however, a recursive descent function
merely returns a tree that was assembled by a different function.
The function <i>optParameterList</i> is an example of this:
<br/>

<pre>
    function optParameterList()
        {
        if (parameterListPending())
            return parameterList();
        else
            return null; //NULL signifies an empty list
        }
</pre>

If one uses 
<code>null</code> as a sentinel value for <i>empty</i>, then there
is no need for <i>optParameterList</i> to build its own tagged parse tree.

<h2> Building a pretty printer
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

Speaking of recreating the source code from parse trees,
a program known as a
<i>pretty printer</i> does just that.
Recall that lexemes are objects that can hold any
kind of value in the language and that the component <i>ival</i> stores the
value of integer lexemes and that the component <i>sval</i> stores the value
of variable and string lexemes. One possible way of implementing the
pretty printer is through a switch statement that steps through all the
possible lexeme types:
<br/>

<pre>
    function prettyPrint(tree)
        {
        switch (tree.type)
            {
            case INTEGER  { print(tree.ival);}
            case VARIABLE { print(tree.sval); }
            case STRING   { print(&#39;\&quot;&#39;, tree.sval, &#39;\&quot;&#39;); }
            case OPAREN
                {
                print(&quot;(&quot;);
                prettyPrint(tree.right);
                print(&quot;)&quot;);
                }
            case UMINUS
                {
                print(&quot;-&quot;);
                print(tree.right);
                }
            case BINARY
                {
                prettyPrint(tree.right.left);  //the left operand
                print(tree.left);              //the operator
                prettyPrint(tree.right.right); //the right operand
                }
            ...
            else { fatal(&quot;bad expression!&quot;); }
            }
        }
</pre>

This pretty printer is pretty basic and not very pretty. In fact,
it prints an entire expression on a single line, regardless of its
size.
The pretty printing code for a function definition might look like:
<br/>

<pre>
    case FUNCTION
        {
        print(&quot;function &quot;);
        prettyPrint(tree.left);
        print(&quot;(&quot;);
        prettyPrint(tree.right.left);
        print(&quot;) { &quot;);
        prettyPrint(tree.right.right);
        println(&quot;}&quot;);
        }
</pre>

More sophisticated pretty printers have additional arguments, the
most useful of which is an indentation level. However, getting a pretty
printer to print out beautiful looking code is a rather tedious process,
involving much trial and error.
<br/>
<br/>
Even an ugly pretty printer is useful, as it can tell you whether your
parse tree correctly represents the original source code. Moreover,
it can be used to implement print statements in your language; if
your pretty printer can handle every kind of parse tree in your
language, a print function based upon your pretty printer will be
able to do the same.
