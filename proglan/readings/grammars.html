<h2> Introduction
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

The set of rules that tell you whether a sentence is correctly structured
is called a <i>grammar</i>.
Here is a simple, and very incomplete, grammar for English:
<br/>

<pre>
    sentence : nounPhrase verbPhrase PERIOD
    nounPhrase : ARTICLE ADJECTIVE NOUN
    verbPhrase : VERB nounPhrase
</pre>

In this description, the three lines are <i>grammar rules</i>. The
token before the colon is the thing you want to build (or deconstruct).
The tokens that appear
after the token describe how one constructs or breaks down the thing
to the left of the colon.
The tokens that are all-caps, such as PERIOD and ARTICLE,
refer to things that cannot be broken down further and, int
this example, refer
to English
words and punctuation. The tokens that are all (or mostly) lowercase denote
higher-level structures that can be broken down. The first of the three
rules can be stated as:
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="indent">
<i>A sentence is a noun phrase followed by a verb phrase and terminated
with a period</i>
</span>

<br/>
Given these nouns,
<br/>

<pre>
    cow
    water
    dog
</pre>

these articles,
<br/>

<pre>
    the
    a
</pre>

these verbs,
<br/>

<pre>
    drank
    chased
</pre>

and these adjectives,
<br/>

<pre>
    large
    cool
    yappy
</pre>

we can generate a number of syntactically correct sentences, such as:
<br/>

<pre>
    The large cow drank the cool water.
    A yappy dog chased the large cow.
    The cool water chased the cool dog.
    The yappy water drank a large cow.
</pre>

Grammars can also be used to recognize syntactically correct
sentences. For example, the sentence:
<br/>

<pre>
    A large dog drank the cool water.
</pre>

can be fit to the grammar above in the following way:
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="indent">
<image src="parse.jpg">

</span>

<br/>
Note that the grammar above does not allow for the sentence:
<br/>

<pre>
    The large yappy dog drank the water.
</pre>

since the grammar requires a single adjective in a noun phrase. We can
modify the grammar to allow sentences of this form (and still allow for
the sentences that were allowed before modification):
<br/>

<pre>
    sentence : nounPhrase verbPhrase PERIOD
    nounPhrase : ARTICLE adjList NOUN          //ADJECTIVE changed to adjList
    verbPhrase : VERB nounPhrase
    adjList : ADJECTIVE | ADJECTIVE adjList
</pre>

The newly added rule, <i>adjList</i>, says that:
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="indent">
<i>An adjective list is an adjective or it is an adjective followed by more
adjectives</i>
</span>


<br/>
The symbol 
<code>|</code> denotes a choice.
<br/>
<br/>
We can also allow for sentences like:
<br/>

<pre>
    The dog drank water.
</pre>

with a further modification:
<br/>

<pre>
    sentence : nounPhrase verbPhrase PERIOD
    nounPhrase : optArticle optAdjList NOUN    //modified
    verbPhrase : VERB nounPhrase
    optArticle : ARTICLE | *empty*             //modified
    optAdjList : adjList | *empty*             //modified
    adjList : ADJECTIVE | ADJECTIVE adjList
</pre>

The <i>optArticle</i> rule says that:
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="indent">
<i>An optional article is an article or is omitted</i>
</span>

<br/>
<!-- section -->
<h2> Syntax versus Semantics
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

Syntax tells you if the sentence is constructed correctly. Semantics tells
you whether a correctly structured sentence makes any sense. The sentence:
<br/>

<pre>
    The box drank water.
</pre>

is correct syntactically speaking
(subject then verb then object) but seems wrong since boxes don't
normally drink.
An oft-made mistake is to attempt to enforce semantics with a grammar,
especially when developing grammars for programming languages.
<br/>
<!-- section -->
<h2> Programming Language Grammars
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

A grammar simply describes the structure of the sentences in a
language. A source code program can be consider a collection
of sentences, with the sentences corresponding to programming language
expressions. Therefore, a grammar can be used to describe expressions.
<br/>
<br/>
As an example, the expression that involves adding two numbers together
might be described as: A sum is a 
<code>NUMBER</code> followed by a 
<code>PLUS</code> sign
followed by another NUMBER. Noting that we can also add variables bound
to numbers as well, we can make the description more general by using
two descriptions or rules:
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="indent">
A <i>sum</i> is a <i>unary</i>
followed by a 
<code>PLUS</code> sign followed by another <i>unary</i>
</span>

and
<span class="indent">
A <i>unary</i> is a 
<code>NUMBER</code> or a 
<code>VARIABLE</code>
</span>


<br/>
We use the name <i>unary</i> to denote something that is not
a binary expression.
We can formalize this concept of description and decide upon some
conventions for specifying a grammar. The most common descriptive
formalization for grammars is the Backus-Naur Form, or <span style="font-family: sans;">BNF</span>,
originally
developed to formally specify the grammar of FORTRAN. We will use a
simplified subset of <span style="font-family: sans;">BNF</span>
that is very easy to read and, when the time
comes, easy to implement.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-family: sans;">BNF</span> is best described through a series of examples.
The <i>sum</i> pattern described above would be rendered as follows
in <span style="font-family: sans;">BNF</span>:
<br/>

<pre>
    sum : unary PLUS unary
      
    unary : NUMBER 
            
    unary : VARIABLE
</pre>

In a rule, the item to the left of the colon is known as a <i>non-terminal</i>,
that is to say, something that can be broken down into finer parts. How
the non-terminal is broken down is described to the right of the
colon. In this case, a sum can be broken down into a 
<code>PLUS</code> sign and two
primaries. When something cannot be broken down any further, it is denoted
a <i>terminal</i>, that is to say, the breaking down process terminates. As a
convention, non-terminals will be written in mostly lower-case letters,
while terminals will be written in mostly upper-case letters. As another
convention, the non-terminal to the left of the colon is thought of as the
name of the rule. In the grammar above, we might say we have a
<i>sum</i> rule and two <i>unary</i> rules.
<br/>
<br/>
Note that both terminals and non terminals can appear
on the right-hand-side of a rule. As a consequence, a non-terminal on the
right-hand-side of a rule must necessarily appear on the left-hand-side
of at least one rule.
<br/>
From the example, it can be seen the that the same non-terminal can
name more than one rule. Multiple rules headed by the same non-terminal
indicate a choice. In this case, a unary is a 
<code>NUMBER</code> or it is a

<code>VARIABLE</code>. Rather than have two <i>unary</i> rules, the rules can be combined
using the vertical bar, or <i>pipe</i>, symbol:
<br/>

<pre>
    unary : NUMBER | VARIABLE
</pre>

Note that the vertical bar has very low
precedence. Rules with choices are often written to
emphasize the low precedence of the vertical bar:
<br/>

<pre>
    unary : NUMBER
          | VARIABLE
</pre>

Concatenation (one thing following another) and alternation (one thing
or another) are the only operators we will need from <span style="font-family: sans;">BNF</span>. Other
operations such as the <i>Kleene star</i> and <i>Kleene plus</i>, which
indicate zero or more of a thing and one or more of a thing, respectively,
as well as parenthetical grouping, make for a more concise grammar,
but can get in the way of turning the grammar into an actual program for
determining whether a sequence of words are correctly ordered or not. For
this reason, we will make do with concatenation and alteration alone.
<br/>
<!-- subsection -->
<h3> Recognizing lists
<br/>
</h3><!-- subsection ENDED -->

Consider the problem of finding a grammar rule for recognizing a comma
separated list of items. With respect to programming languages, lists
are often used to supply arguments in a function call. A list of three
items is easy:
<br/>

<pre>
    list : item COMMA item COMMA item
</pre>

as is a list of four, five,
and six items. We can even write
a rule for two or three items:
<br/>

<pre>
    list : item COMMA item
         | item COMMA item COMMA item
</pre>

We could continue this approach by limiting the number of items in a list
and providing an alternative for each length under the limit. In addition
to being tedious and inelegant, it would be a very poor programming
language that restricts the number of arguments to a user defined
function. A recursive grammar rule can bail us out of this dilemma,
letting us have lists of arbitrary length:
<br/>

<pre>
    list : item
         | item COMMA list
</pre>

This rule reads literally as &ldquo;a list is either an item or it is an item
followed by a comma followed by a list of items&rdquo;.
<br/>
Following in this vein of recognizing lists with respect to function
calls, what about a function call of no arguments or one argument?
Here is a rule giving three alternatives for function calls...
<br/>

<pre>
    functionCall : VARIABLE OPEN_PAREN CLOSE_PAREN
                 | VARIABLE OPEN_PAREN item CLOSE_PAREN
                 | VARIABLE OPEN_PAREN list CLOSE_PAREN
</pre>

where 
<code>OPEN_PAREN</code> and 
<code>CLOSE_PAREN</code>
are terminals describing open parenthesis and
close parenthesis, respectively. Do we need separate rules for describing
function calls of zero, one, or multiple arguments? Close inspection of
the list grammar rule reveals that a list can be a single item, so the
second alternative of <i>functionCall</i> is unnecessary. A convenient way to
combine the first and third alternatives is to introduce the concept of
an optional list, where an optional list is a list or no list at all.
The rule for <i>functionCall</i> then becomes:
<br/>

<pre>
    functionCall : VARIABLE OPEN_PAREN optionalList CLOSE_PAREN
</pre>

with <i>optionalList</i>
defined as:
<br/>

<pre>
    optionalList : list
                 | *empty*
</pre>

The symbol 
<code>*empty*</code> denotes empty or nothing.
Literally, the <i>optionalList</i>
rule says that &ldquo;an optional list is either a list or it is nothing
at all&rdquo;.
<br/>
<!-- subsection -->
<h3> Left versus Right Recursion
<br/>
</h3><!-- subsection ENDED -->

Grammar rules themselves, at least the recursive ones, have a handed-ness.
The recursive version of the <i>list</i> rule, given above,
is <i>right recursive</i>, as the
recursive part of the alternative is on the right.
We could have written the <i>list</i> rule like this:
<br/>

<pre>
    list : item
         | list COMMA item
</pre>

or even like this:
<br/>

<pre>
    list : item
         | list COMMA list
</pre>

In the first of these rewrites, the non-terminal <i>list</i> appears immediately
after a colon or a pipe.
Since <i>list</i> appears leftmost on
the right hand side of an alternative,
we say the rule is <i>left recursive</i>. The second rewrite is both
left and right recursive.
<br/>
<br/>
Theoretically, it does not matter if a rule is left or right recursive,
Practically,
one way may be preferable to the other.
When a grammar is used to build a structured
version of the input, known as a <i>parse trees</i>,
left recursion is preferable for left-associative
operations, Similarly, right recursion is preferable for right-associative
operations.
On the other hand, it
is extremely easy to implement
code to build parse trees from
a purely
right recursive grammar,
so when it becomes time to do that,
we will transform any left recursive rules to right recursion.
<br/>
<br/>
<!-- section -->
<h2> A Programming Language Grammar
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

Recall that expressions can serve as the sentences of a programming
language. Once you have a grammar for expressions, 90 percent of the
work in developing a language is done. We've already looked at one
kind of expression, a sum of numbers. We also might like a product of
numbers as well:
<br/>

<pre>
    product : unary
            | unary TIMES product
</pre>

where 
<code>TIMES</code> is a terminal representing multiplication. Noticing the
similarity between the product and sum grammar rules, we can generalize
the two into:
<br/>

<pre>
    expression : unary
               | unary operator expression

    operator : PLUS | TIMES
</pre>

An unintended, yet beneficial, consequence of this generalization is that
we can now recognize expressions involving both 
<code>PLUS</code> and 
<code>TIMES</code>,
as in: <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow>	<mn>4</mn>	<mo>+</mo>	<mn>3</mn>	<mo>*</mo>	<mn>2</mn></mrow></math>.
The operator rule is also easily extended by adding alternatives
for the terminals representing the subtraction and division operators.
We can also extend the <i>unary</i> rule to encompass other things that
can be combined by operators.
<br/>

<pre>
    unary : NUMBER
          | VARIABLE
          | OPEN_PAREN expression CLOSE_PAREN
          | MINUS unary
</pre>

The third alternative allows us to group expressions parenthetically,
overriding any precedence of operators we wish to implement.
The last alternative allows us to the negate the values of variables
and other unaries, as in:
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="indent">
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow>	<mo>-</mo>	<mi>a</mi>	<mo>+</mo>	<mo>-</mo>	<mrow>		<mo form="prefix">(</mo>		<mi>b</mi>		<mo>*</mo>		<mo>-</mo>		<mi>c</mi>		<mo form="postfix">)</mo>	</mrow></mrow></math>
</span>


<br/>
For another example, consider expanding the unary rule so that
expressions can involve function calls:
<br/>

<pre>
    unary : NUMBER
          | VARIABLE
          | OPEN_PAREN expression CLOSE_PAREN
          | MINUS unary
          | VARIABLE OPEN_PAREN optExpressionList CLOSE_PAREN
</pre>

The third alternative describes
a C-like function calls.
<br/>
<br/>
The grammar rule and implementation of <i>optExpressionList</i> is similar the
grammar rules for <i>list</i> seen earlier.
<br/>
<!-- subsection -->
<h3> Conditionals
<br/>
</h3><!-- subsection ENDED -->

The simplest conditional is the <i>if statement</i>. To simply things,
we will force both the <i>then</i> clause and the <i>else</i> clause to be <i>blocks</i>
which we will describe later.
Finally,
we will allow a generic expression to serve as the test expression.
<br/>

<pre>
    ifStatement : IF OPEN_PAREN expression CLOSE_PAREN block optElse

    optElse : ELSE block
            | *empty*
</pre>

This grammar rule forces a chain of <i>if statements</i> to be nested:
<br/>

<pre>
    if (a &lt; b)
        {
        result = a;
        }
    else
        {
        if (b &lt; c)
            {
            result = b;
            }
        else
            {
            result = c;
            }
        }
</pre>

A simple change to the <i>else</i> rule allows <i>if statements</i> to be chained:
<br/>

<pre>
    optElse : ELSE block
            | ELSE ifStatement
            | *empty*
</pre>

Now, the above example could be rewritten as:
<br/>

<pre>
    if (a &lt; b)
        {
        result = a;
        }
    else if (b &lt; c)
        {
        result = b;
        }
    else
        {
        result = c;
        }
</pre>

<!-- subsection -->
<h3> Iteration
<br/>
</h3><!-- subsection ENDED -->

The simplest iterator is a <i>while loop</i>. Again, for simplicity's sake,
we will the body of the
<i>while loop</i> to be a <i>block</i>.
<br/>

<pre>
    whileLoop : WHILE OPEN_PAREN expression CLOSE_PAREN block
</pre>

<!-- subsection -->
<h3> Sequence
<br/>
</h3><!-- subsection ENDED -->

A sequence of programming language statements is known as a <i>block</i>.
Suppose we wish to enclose a block with braces, as is done in C-like
languages. The <i>block</i> rule might look something like:
<br/>

<pre>
    block : OPEN_BRACE statements CLOSE_BRACE
</pre>

A <i>statements</i> rule would look very similar to our <i>list</i> rule:
<br/>

<pre>
    statements : statement
               | statement statements
</pre>

Finally, a <i>statement</i> could be an expression, an if statement, or a
<i>while loop</i>, at a minimum. In keeping with a C-like
programming language, a <i>statement</i> rule might look like:
<br/>

<pre>
    statement : expression SEMICOLON
              | ifStatement
              | whileLoop
</pre>

These rules allow code that looks like:
<br/>

<pre>
    {
    f(x);
    if (a &lt; b) { min = a; } else { min = b; }
    while (x &gt;= 0)
        {
        if (x &gt; 0)
            {
            t = t + 1;
            }
        x = x - 2;
        }
    }
</pre>

You can see that with a few rules, we can have quite complicated code!
<br/>
<!-- subsection -->
<h3> Definitions
<br/>
</h3><!-- subsection ENDED -->

The final major piece in our grammar is <i>definitions</i>. Programming
languages often have two kinds of definitions, variable definitions
and function definitions. A variable definition in a dynamically-typed,
C-like language
might look like:
<br/>

<pre>
    varDef : VAR VARIABLE ASSIGN expression SEMICOLON
</pre>

where the keyword 
<code>VAR</code> introduces a variable definition. In
a statically-typed language, keywords representing type, such
as 
<code>TYPE_INT</code> or 
<code>TYPE_STRING</code>, would substitute for 
<code>VAR</code>. This rule
would allow definitions like:
<br/>

<pre>
    var a = 0;
    var b = f(x) * (g(y) + z);
</pre>

The initializer could be made optional with a rule rewrite:
<br/>

<pre>
    varDef : VAR VARIABLE ASSIGN expression SEMICOLON
                  | VAR VARIABLE SEMICOLON
</pre>

An equivalent rewrite would be:
<br/>

<pre>
    varDef : VAR VARIABLE optInit SEMICOLON

    optInit : ASSIGN expression
            | *empty*
</pre>

Function definitions are straightforward:
<br/>

<pre>
    functionDef : FUNCTION VARIABLE OPEN_PAREN parameterList CLOSE_PAREN block
</pre>

where 
<code>FUNCTION</code> is a keyword introducing a function definition
and <i>parameterList</i> is a list of variables. Why is <i>parameterList</i>
not a list of expressions?
<br/>
<!-- subsection -->
<h3> Finishing out a grammar
<br/>
</h3><!-- subsection ENDED -->

As stated earlier, non-terminals describe collections that can be broken
down further. When writing a grammar, make heavy use (and re-use)
of non-terminals. When you use a non-terminal in a rule, you must
define it if you haven't already done so. When you have written a rule
for your last non-terminal, you have finished your grammar.
