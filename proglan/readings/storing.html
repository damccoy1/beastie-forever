This article assumes you have read
<a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-21.html#%_sec_3.2">The Environment Model of Evaluation</a>.
</i>
<br/>
<br/>
The term <i>scope</i> refers to the set of variables which
are accessible at any execution point in a computer program.
Most modern programming languages use <i>static</i> scope,
meaning, one can resolve a reference to a non-local variable
simply by looking at a printout of the code. If a variable
is not defined in the local scope, successive outer scopes
are searched until the variable is found.
<br/>
<br/>
One possible implementation of scope uses the <i>environment model</i>.
An
<i>environment</i> can be thought of as linked list of tables;
each table (from front to back) holds the variables and
their values for ever increasingly outer scopes.
An environment can also be used during parsing to determine
if a variable has been defined before use and to detect
type errors in statically typed languages.
<br/>
<br/>
There are five environment routines that are part of an
<i>environment passing</i> language interpreter:
<br/>

<ul>

<li>

 
<code>insertEnv(e,v,w)</code>
placing an variable <i>v</i> and its initial value <i>w</i>
into the most local table of environment <i>e</i>
</li>

<li>

 
<code>lookupEnv(e,v)</code>
find the value of a variable <i>v</i> in environment <i>e</i>;
tables are searched from most local to most
outer; the value of the first occurrence of the variable is returned
</li>

<li>

 
<code>updateEnv(e,v,w)</code>
change the value of first occurrence of a variable <i>v</i> to <i>w</i>
in environment <i>e</i>; tables are searched from most local
to most outer
</li>

<li>

 
<code>extendEnv(e,m,n)</code>
extend the environment <i>e</i> with a list of variables <i>m</i>
and a list of values <i>n</i>; a new environment is returned with the
variables and values placed in a table in front of the given
environment; the given environment is unmodified
</li>

<li>

 
<code>create()</code>
returns an empty environment; can be a wrapper for

<code>extend(null,null,null)</code>
</li>

</ul>


Other useful environment routines are:
<br/>

<ul>

<li>

 
<code>displayEnv(e)</code>
display environment <i>e</i>; print out a readable version of
each table in the given environment;
if a value is an environment, do not recursively display it
</li>

<li>

 
<code>displayLocalEnv(e)</code>
Like <i>displayEnv</i>, but only prints out the most local table.
</li>

</ul>

<h2> Data Structures for Environments
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

One possibility for implementing environments is to store the variables
and values in a particular environment table as two parallel linked lists.
Normally,
such an approach is not ideal due to the linear time access of
of variable values and the possibility that the
parallel arrays getting out of sync. However, we will see
that using parallel arrays allows us to implement function calls
very efficiently.
<br/>
<br/>
Continuing our standard approach of using <i>Lexeme</i> objects for
just about everything, we will implement environments with lexemes. We
postulate the existence of the lexical functions <i>cons</i>, <i>car</i>, <i>cdr</i>.
which are analogues to the eponymous Scheme functions:
<br/>

<pre>
    function cons(type,carValue,cdrValue) { return this; }
    function car(cell) { return cell.carValue; }
    function cdr(cell) { return cell.cdrValue; }
</pre>

In addition, we will add the functions
<i>setCar</i> and <i>setCdr</i>, which destructively modify the head and
tail of a list, respectively, and <i>type</i>, which returns the
type of a cons cell:
<br/>

<pre>
    function setCar(cell,value) { cell.carValue = value; }
    function setCdr(cell,value) { cell.cdrValue = value; }
    function type(cell) { return type; }
</pre>

<!-- section -->
<h2> Implementing Environment Functions
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

By implementing a table
with with a cons cell version of a linked list and an environment as a cons
cell version of a linked list of tables,
the basic environment routines
are rather straightforward to implement.
<br/>
<!-- subsection -->
<h3> Creating environment structures
<br/>
</h3><!-- subsection ENDED -->

After a parse tree is built from the source code, one <i>evaluates</i>
the tree. When variable and function definitions are evaluated,
changes to the current scope occur. In other words, the environment
that is holding the current scope of the execution point is
populated with variables and their values. Prior to that, however,
there are no variables and no values. Therefore, at the start, one
needs an empty environment to populate.
<br/>
<br/>
Because an environment structure is a list of parallel lists,
an empty environment structure has no bindings and thus can
be represented by two empty lists joined together into a list
of one item. An easy way
to do this is to extend the null environment with a null
variable list and a null value list:
<br/>

<pre>
    function createEnv()
        {
        return extendEnv(null,null,null);
        }
</pre>

We will implement <i>extendEnv</i> in the next section.
<br/>
<!-- subsection -->
<h3> Extending an environment
<br/>
</h3><!-- subsection ENDED -->

The <i>extendEnv</i> function is used to implement function
calls. The list of variables passed to the function is
the list of formal parameters of the function being called.
The list of values passed is the evaluated list of arguments
in the function call. The environment being extended is
the environment under which the function being called was
defined.
<br/>
<br/>
To extend a given environment, we simply make a new table out
of the given variable and value lists and
<i>cons</i> it onto the front of the environment:
step is performed for a function call;
<br/>

<pre>
    function extendEnv(env,variables,values)
        {
        return cons(ENV,makeTable(variables,values),env);
        }
</pre>

Note that we tag the returned structure with an 
<code>ENV</code> type, so
that we can easily identify environment structures. The
<i>makeTable</i> function is just as simple:
<br/>

<pre>
    function makeTable(variables,values)
        {
        return cons(TABLE,variables,values);
        }
</pre>

<!-- subsection -->
<h3> Looking up and updating the value of a variable
<br/>
</h3><!-- subsection ENDED -->

When code being evaluated references a particular variable, the value
of that variable in the current scope needs to be retrieved or
updated, depending on the type of reference. When a value
is needed, this is referred as an <i>r-value</i>. When a value
needs to be updated, this is referred to as an <i>l-value</i>.
<br/>
<br/>
Finding the <i>r-value</i> or the <i>l-value</i> of a variable simply means
walking the variables list in the first table of
a given environment until the variable is found. Its value
is in the analogous position in the parallel list of values.
If the variable is not found in that table, we
scan the parallel lists in the second table, and so on. Using
that strategy, the <i>lookupEnv</i> routine can be implemented as:
<br/>

<pre>
    function lookupEnv(env,variable)
        {
        while (env != null)
            {
            var table = car(env);
            var variables = car(table);
            var vals = cdr(table);
            while (variables != null)
                {
                if (sameVariable(variable,car(variables)))
                    return car(values);
                //walk the lists in parallel
                vars = cdr(variables);
                vals = cdr(values);
                }
            env = cdr(env);
            }

        Fatal(&quot;variable &quot;,variable,&quot; is undefined&quot;);

        return null;
        }
</pre>

The <i>update</i> function is similar, only <i>setCar</i> is used to set
the appropriate car pointer of the values list.
<br/>
<br/>
Consider the code statement:
<br/>

<pre>
    x = 2 * y;
</pre>

Since the variable <i>y</i> is on the right-hand side of an assignment
operator, it is an <i>r-value</i> and thus the <i>lookupEnv</i> routine is
used to retrieve its value. Conversely, the variable <i>x</i> is on
the left-hand side of the assignment and is therefore an <i>l-value</i>.
Once the value of 2 * y is
calculated, the <i>updateEnv</i> routine is used to change the value
of <i>x</i> from its previous value.
Technically speaking, the <i>l-value</i> of a variable is the location
of its value in the values list.
<br/>
<!-- subsection -->
<h3> Defining a Variable
<br/>
</h3><!-- subsection ENDED -->

A variable is inserted into the local environment any time
a simple variable is declared or a function defined. Note
that the local environment is represented as the first two
parallel lists in a list of tables. This makes the
task quite easy:
<br/>

<pre>
    function insert(variable,value,env)
        {
        var table = car(env);
        setCar(table,cons(GLUE,variable,car(table)));
        setCdr(table,cons(GLUE,value,cdr(table)));
        return value;
        }
</pre>

Notice that the new variable and its value are put on the
front of the parallel lists, since this placement is much
faster than placing them at the end of the parallel lists.
The 
<code>GLUE</code> type is used when there is no need to give the
<i>cons</i> cell a specific type.
The added advantage of this placement is that redefinitions
in the same scope shadow previous definitions.
