<h2> Introduction
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

A
recognizer is like a souped-up scanner; Like a scanner,
it repeatedly calls <i>lex</i> to serve up lexemes.
Additionally,
it checks each lexeme against a grammar that describes the
language in the text being scanned.
Ultimately, a recognizer reports whether the entire text is syntactically
correct or not.
<br/>
<!-- section -->
<h2> Recursive Descent Parsing
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

Building a recognizer for a typical programming language grammar is
rather easy. There are many tools for turning a grammar into a
recognizer, but there is a technique called <i>recursive descent parsing</i>
that obviates the need for tools.
A <i>parser</i> is a recognizer that also builds an abstract representation
of the text being scanned and is necessary for creating a language
interpreter.
However, it is useful to use the recursive descent technique to
construct a recognizer first and then convert the recognizer into a parser.
<br/>
<br/>
A recursive descent recognizer is
composed of a set of functions,
each of which corresponds to a
rule in the grammar.
It will become apparent why the appellation
<i>recursive descent</i> is used to describe recognizers and parsers built in
this fashion.
<br/>
<!-- section -->
<h2> Transforming grammars
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

There is a straightforward transformation from a grammar to a set of
recursive descent functions.
Each
grammar rule becomes a single function implementing the grammar rule.
The terms <i>lhs</i> and <i>rhs</i> denote the left-hand side and the
right-hand side of the grammar
rule,
respectively,
with the colon serving as the line of demarcation.
<br/>

<ul>

<li>


the <i>lhs</i> side of a rule becomes the name of the
implementing function -- the terminals and non-terminals of
the <i>rhs</i> guide the implementation of the body of the function
</li>

<li>


each terminal on the <i>rhs</i> corresponds to a call to a function
named <i>match</i> -- <i>match</i> is used to ensure the given
terminal is pending in the data stream
</li>

<li>


a vertical bar on the <i>rhs</i> indicates a need to call a
predicate function named <i>check</i> or a <i>pending</i> function --
these predicates are used to see which
alternative is present in the data stream
</li>

<li>


each non-terminal on the <i>rhs</i> corresponds to a call to
the function named by that non-terminal
</li>

</ul>


Even before we get into the details of <i>match</i>, <i>check</i>,
and the <i>pending</i> functions,
an example will
be
quite useful.
Consider the grammar rule for specifying an arbitrarily
long
sum of numbers:
<br/>

<pre>
    sum : NUMBER 
        | NUMBER PLUS sum
</pre>

An implementation of this grammar rule using the above transformation
strategy yields:
<br/>

<pre>
    function sum() 
        { 
        match(NUMBER); 
        if (check(PLUS)) 
            { 
            match(PLUS); 
            sum(); 
            } 
        // else done
        }
</pre>

Note that both alternatives begin with the terminal 
<code>NUMBER</code>,
so a
call to 
<code>match(NUMBER)</code> is made.
The function <i>match</i> is used to
ensure
that the next lexeme in the data stream is a 
<code>NUMBER</code>.
If <i>match</i>
fails,
that means that the input is not valid,
i.e. the lexemes are not in the
correct
order.
If <i>match</i> is successful,
it advances the lexical stream (via a
call
to <i>lex</i>).
Assuming a 
<code>NUMBER</code> was matched,
we then check
to
see which alternative is present in the lexical stream.
If a 
<code>PLUS</code>
lexeme is pending,
then the second alternative must be present -- we
match
the 
<code>PLUS</code> and then recursively call <i>sum</i>.
If not,
the
first
alternative was present in the lexical stream; there is nothing more to
do
since we matched entirety of the sum with the initial call to <i>match</i>.
<br/>
<br/>
It is relatively easy to see that not all grammars are suitable for
recursive
descent parsing.
Suppose the above grammar rule for sum had been
written
equivalently as:
<br/>

<pre>
    sum : NUMBER
        | sum PLUS NUMBER
</pre>

Using the transformation strategy,
we get:
<br/>

<pre>
    function sum() 
        { 
        if (check(NUMBER); 
            match(NUMBER); 
        else 
            { 
            sum(); 
            match(PLUS); 
            match(NUMBER); 
            } 
        }
</pre>

There are major problems with this function.
Suppose a 
<code>NUMBER</code>
lexeme
is not pending in the lexical stream.
The <i>else</i> branch is then taken and
an
immediate recursive call to <i>sum</i> is made.
Since the lexical
stream
has not been advanced (only <i>match</i> advances the lexical stream),
the
function falls into a recursive infinite loop.
If there is a NUMBER pending, followed by a PLUS,
then the else branch is never taken
and the following PLUS is never recognized.
For this reason, one of the primary
rules
of recursive descent parsing is that the grammar may not have any left
recursion,
either directly or indirectly.
<br/>
<br/>
Usually,
common sense can be used to eliminate direct left
recursion.
Since
all non-terminals must eventually ground out to terminals,
we examine <i>sum</i>
and see that a <i>sum</i> must begin with a 
<code>NUMBER</code>.
as stated
prior.
Moreover,
it is relatively easy to see from the rule that a sum
is simply a string of numbers separated by plus signs.
The right
recursive version of
sum is immediately suggested from this fact.
that rule to a right-recursive format. There is a formal technique for
If a right-recursive analog is not apparent, there is
a formal way to
deal with immediately left-recursive rules. Given
a left recursive rule of the form:
<br/>

<pre>
    a : a x | b
</pre>

where <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are strings of terminals and non-terminals, an
equivalent pair of rules is:
<br/>

<pre>
    a : b r
    r : x r | *empty*
</pre>

Performing such a transformation on the <i>sum</i> rule binds <i>x</i> to

<code>PLUS NUMBER</code> and <i>b</i> to 
<code>NUMBER</code>, yielding:
<br/>

<pre>
    sum : NUMBER sumR

    sumR : PLUS NUMBER sumR | *empty*
</pre>

These two rules, neither of which is left-recursive, replace the original
<i>sum</i> rule.
<br/>

<h2> Support functions for recursive descent parsing.
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

A small number of lexical helper functions simplify the task of
creating a recursive descent recognizer,
two of which,
<i>match</i> and <i>check</i>,
are
mentioned in the previous section.
These helper functions and their uses are:
<br/>
<span class="indent">
<table>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left";> <b>function</b> </td><td style="text-align:left";> <b>purpose</b> </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left";> <i>advance</i> </td><td style="text-align:left";> move to the next lexeme in the input stream </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left";> <i>match</i> </td><td style="text-align:left";> like <i>advance</i> but forces the current lexeme to be matched </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left";> <i>check</i> </td><td style="text-align:left";> check whether or not the current lexeme is of the given type </td>
</tr>
</table>


</span>

<br/>
The functions are considered lexical interface functions because
they deal
with the lexemes that make up the input stream and isolate the recognizer
from
the details of the lexical analyzer.
In addition to simplifying the
design
of the recognizer,
they,
themselves,
are also easy to implement.
Here are
basic
implementations of <i>advance</i>,
<i>match</i>,
and <i>check</i>:
<br/>

<pre>
    function check(type) 
        { 
        return type(CurrentLexeme) == type; 
        }
  
    function advance() 
        { 
        CurrentLexeme = lex(); 
        } 
  
    function match(type) 
        { 
        matchNoAdvance(type); 
        advance(); 
        }
  
    function matchNoAdvance(type)
        {
        if (!check(type))
            fatal(&quot;syntax error&quot;);
        }
</pre>

The variable <i>CurrentLexeme</i> is global to these interface
functions.
<br/>
<br/>
If it hasn't yet occurred to you,
the set of
terminals
in a grammar is exactly the set of lexemes returned that can possibly
be
returned by <i>lex</i>.
<br/>
<!-- section -->
<h2> Recognizing expressions
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

Recall the expression rule:
<br/>

<pre>
    expression : unary operator expression 
               | unary
      
    operator : PLUS 
             | TIMES 
      
    unary : NUMBER 
          | VARIABLE
</pre>

At this point,
let's try to implement the expression rule as a
recursive descent parsing function.
We get something like:
<br/>

<pre>
    function expression() 
        { 
        unary(); 
        if (operatorPending()) 
            { 
            operator(); 
            expression(); 
            } 
        }
</pre>

Note that the function <i>operatorPending</i> is used instead of <i>check</i>
to distinguish between the two alternatives.
Examination of <i>check</i>
reveals
that it is used to distinguish terminals pending on the lexical stream.
Here,
an attempt is being made to see if a non-terminal is pending.
A
non-terminal
is <i>pending</i> if any of the terminals comprising its <i>first set</i> are
pending on the lexical stream.
The <i>first set</i> of a non-terminal is simply the set of terminals
that
can begin the non-terminal.
In the case of operator,
the first set is 
<code>{PLUS,TIMES}</code>,
yielding the following implementation of <i>operatorPending</i>:
<br/>

<pre>
    function operatorPending() 
        { 
        return check(PLUS) || check(TIMES); 
        }
</pre>

More generally,
given a rule of the form:
<br/>

<pre>
    a : A b | C d | e f
</pre>

where lowercase letters are non-terminals and uppercase letters are
terminals,
the associated pending function for the rule would be:
<br/>

<pre>
    function aPending() 
        { 
        return check(A) || check(C) || ePending();
        }
</pre>

In general,
use <i>check</i> to see if
a
terminal is pending in the lexical stream and define a <i>zzzPending</i>
function
to see if the non-terminal <i>zzz</i> is pending in the lexical stream.
<br/>
<br/>
Consider, as before, expanding the <i>unary</i> rule so
that expressions can involve function calls and can be grouped with
parentheses:
<br/>

<pre>
    unary : NUMBER 
          | VARIABLE 
          | VARIABLE OPAREN optEexpressionList CPAREN 
          | OPAREN expression CPAREN
</pre>

Here is the
implementation of the new unary:
<br/>

<pre>
    function unary() 
        { 
        if (check(NUMBER)) 
            { 
            match(NUMBER); 
            } 
        else if (check(VARIABLE)) 
            { 
            // two cases! 
            match(VARIABLE); 
            if (check(OPAREN))
                { 
                match(OPAREN); 
                optExpressionList(); 
                match(CPAREN); 
                } 
            } 
        else 
            { 
            match(OPAREN); 
            expression(); 
            match(CPAREN); 
            } 
        }
</pre>

Again,
note the close correspondence between the function <i>unary</i>
and the <i>unary</i> grammar rule.
The only tricky part is handling
the two alternatives that begin with 
<code>VARIABLE</code>.
These are
folded into a single top-level alternative.
Inside that alternative,
the two forms are
distinguished with a call to 
<code>check(OPAREN)</code>.
To reduce this
complexity,
the grammar rule for <i>unary</i> could have been written more clearly as:
<br/>

<pre>
    unary : NUMBER 
          | varExpression 
          | OPAREN expression CPAREN
  
    varExpression : VARIABLE 
                  | VARIABLE OPAREN optEexpressionList CPAREN
</pre>

<br/>
yielding implementations of:
<br/>

<pre>
    function unary() 
        { 
        if (check(NUMBER)) 
            { 
            match(NUMBER); 
            } 
        else if (varExpressionPending()) 
            { 
            varExpression(); 
            } 
        else 
            { 
            match(OPAREN); 
            expression(); 
            match(CPAREN); 
            } 
        }

    varExpression() 
        { 
        match(VARIABLE); 
        if (check(OPAREN)) 
            { 
            match(OPAREN); 
            optExpressionList();
            match(CPAREN); 
            } 
        }
  
    varExpressionPending() 
        { 
        return check(VARIABLE); 
        }
</pre>

The grammar rule and implementation of <i>optExpressionList</i> is
similar the grammar rules for list seen earlier.
<br/>
<!-- section -->
<h2> Summary
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

In summary,
each grammar rule corresponds to a function.
Each
non-terminal on the right-hand side corresponds to a function call to
the function that associated with that non-terminal.
Each terminal
corresponds to a call to
<i>match</i>.
Each "or" corresponds to a call to <i>check</i> or a pending function.
It is
as simple
as that.
<br/>
<br/>
As a final note,
the recursive descent functions described thus far
do
not return anything.
The functions merrily move through the lexical
input
stream until it is exhausted or until <i>match</i> detects an error.
Later, you will modify your recognizer so that it
returns <i>abstract syntax trees</i>, commonly referred to as
<i>parse trees</i>.
