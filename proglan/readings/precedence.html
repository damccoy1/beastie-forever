<h2> Associativity and Precedence
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

Suppose you wish to implement a grammar for C-like expressions. It
is not easy for a number of reasons. One is that operators in C have
specific associativities. For example, addition is left-associative while
assignment is right-associative. Another problem is precedence. There are
many levels of precedence in a C expressions. Handling associativity and
precedence at the same time can be tricky. For example, the expression:
<br/>

<pre>
    a = b = c + d * e / 3 - 2 - q
</pre>

should be parsed the same as:
<br/>

<pre>
    (a = (b = (((c + ((d * e) / 3)) - 2) - q)))
</pre>

but it is not obvious how to accomplish this feat. First, we'll look at
incorporating associativity into a grammar.
<br/>
<!-- section -->
<h2> Associativity
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

Consider the following grammar:
<br/>

<pre>
    expression : expression operator expression | unary

    operator : PLUS | MINUS | TIMES | DIVIDES

    unary : VARIABLE | NUMBER | ( expression ) | - unary
</pre>

which implements a significant subset of C expressions. This grammar
is easy to come up with, but it has a few drawbacks. For one, it is
ambiguous. With this grammar, an expression such as:
<br/>

<pre>
    x - y - 3
</pre>

can be recognized as:
<br/>

<pre>
    ((x - y) - 3)
</pre>

or:
<br/>

<pre>
    (x - (y - 3))
</pre>

corresponding to left-associativity and right-associativity,
respectively. We can remove the ambiguity by rewriting the ambiguous
rule as:
<br/>

<pre>
    expression : unary operator expression | unary
</pre>

This forces right associativity. We can also rewrite the rule to force
left associativity:
<br/>

<pre>
    expression : expression operator unary | unary
</pre>

If we wish to implement the left-associative rule using recursive descent
parsing techniques, we quickly run into trouble:
<br/>

<pre>
    function expression()
        {
        var tree;
        if (expressionPending())
            {
            var temp = expression();    //infinite recursion!
            var op = operator();
            op.left = temp;
            op.right = unary();
            tree = op;
            }
        else
            tree = unary();
        return tree;
        }
</pre>

We will fall into an infinite recursive loop because
<i>expressionPending</i> will always return true; what begins
an <i>expression</i> also begins a <i>unary</i>.
The right associative version of expression <i>is</i>:
<br/>

<pre>
    function expression()
        {
        tree = unary();
        if (operatorPending())
            {
            var temp = operator();
            temp.left = tree;
            temp.right = expression();
            tree = temp;
            }
        return tree;
        }
</pre>

This works fine, assuming all the operators recognized by the function
operator are right-associative operators. What if the operators should
be left-associative? Curiously, if we replace the <i>if</i> with a <i>while</i>
and the recursive call to <i>expression</i> with a call to <i>unary</i>, as in:
<br/>

<pre>
    function expression()
        {
        tree = unary();
        while (operatorPending())
            {
            temp = operator();
            temp.left = tree;
            temp.right = unary();
            tree = temp;
            }
        return tree;
        }
</pre>

we still recognize the same language. More curiously, the iterative
function now builds a left-associative parse tree!

If we are to follow the mathematical rules we learned earlier in life,
we would like multiplication to happen before addition regardless of
where the multiplications and additions occur in the expression. Using
the left associative grammar above, the expression:
<br/>

<pre>
    2 + 3 * 5 + 6
</pre>

would be equivalent to:
<br/>

<pre>
    (((2 + 3) * 5) + 6)
</pre>

The structure we would like to see is:
<br/>

<pre>
    ((2 + (3 * 5)) + 6)
</pre>

We can rewrite our grammar to accomplish this goal:
<br/>

<pre>
    expression1 : expression2 operator1 expression1 | expression2

    operator1 : PLUS | MINUS

    expression2 : unary operator2 expression2 | unary

    operator2 : TIMES | DIVIDES

    unary  : VARIABLE | NUMBER | (expression1) | MINUS unary
</pre>

Each numeric suffix in <i>expression1</i> and <i>expression2</i> correspond
to a level of precedence. In this case, the <i>expression1</i> operators
are at a lower level than the <i>expression2</i> operators. These
rules, of course, are naturally right associative. If we wish
operators at a given level to be right associative, we use
the normal recursive implementation of the rule. On the other
hand, if we wish to have all the operators at a level be
left associative, we can implement the rule using the iterative
approach described above.
