<h2> Computability
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

It is thought that a Turing machine is capable of computing
anything that is computable. An alternative to Turing machines,
derived at roughly the same time, was Church's <i>lambda calculus</i>.
The lambda calculus is easy to describe syntactically:

<pre>
    expression : IDENTIFIER
               | (lambda (IDENTIFIER) expression)
               | (expression expression)
</pre>

It is also easy to describe semantically. The first alternative form
of an expression, 
<code>IDENTIFIER</code>, is just a symbol. The second alternative
corresponds to a function definition, while the third alternative
corresponds to a function call. These simple rules describe a programming
language that is thought to be capable, like a Turing machine, of computing
anything that is computable.
<br/>
<br/>
From the calculus, we can see that functions can only take one
argument and that the body of a function is composed of a single
expression. A striking feature of the calculus is the lack of
numbers. Numbers seem rather critical to many computations, but
have no fear. Church came up with a clever way to represent numbers
(integers) using the lambda calculus.
<br/>

<h2> Church numerals
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

Here are the first three Church numerals, that represent the integers
<i>zero</i>, <i>one</i>, and <i>two</i>:

<pre>
    (lambda (f) (lambda (x) x))
    (lambda (f) (lambda (x) (f x)))
    (lambda (f) (lambda (x) (f (f x))))
</pre>

We can see that these numerals take two arguments, <i>f</i> and <i>x</i>,
with the first one <i>f</i> being curried.
The argument <i>f</i> is a function, while the argument <i>x</i> is a suitable
argument to <i>f</i> itself. We can also see that <i>zero</i>, the first
expression, calls the function <i>f</i> zero times, while <i>one</i> calls
<i>f</i> once and <i>two</i> calls it twice, feeding the result of the
first call into the second. By extrapolation, we might guess that
the Church numeral <i>three</i> would be equivalent to the expression:

<pre>
    (lambda (f) (lambda (x) (f (f (f x)))))
</pre>

and we would be right. If we think of <i>x</i> as some base value and
<i>f</i> as an <i>incrementing</i> function, then we can interpret the
Church numeral <i>three</i> as incrementing some base value three times.
We call the successive applications of the incrementor to the base value a
<i>rendering</i>. We can actually see a rendering of a Church numeral
in action.
Suppose we
define both <i>three</i> and an incrementing function in
Scheme:

<pre>
    (define three (lambda (f) (lambda (x) (f (f (f x))))))
    (define (inc z) (+ z 1))
</pre>

Using an integer 0 as our base value, we can force a rendering
of <i>three</i> to show that it is indeed
a representation of the integer 3. This expression:

<pre>
    (inspect ((three inc) 0))
</pre>

prints out:

<pre>
    ((three inc) 0) is 3
</pre>

By calling any Church numeral (it is a function!) with an incrementor
and a base value, we force a rendering.

<h2> Manipulating Church numerals
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

Using the Scheme, we can define lambda calculus-like
mathematical functions that manipulate
Church numerals. Here is the successor function:

<pre>
    (define succ 
        (lambda (n)
            (lambda (f)
                (lambda (x)
                    (f ((n f) x))          ; ((n f) x) is a rendering of n
                    )
                )
            )
        )
</pre>

We can test our successor function by using the above-defined incrementor
function and a base value of integer 0. The expression:

<pre>
    (inspect (((succ three) inc) 0))
</pre>

prints out:

<pre>
    (((succ three) inc) 0) is 4
</pre>

as expected. The successor function works because we apply the incrementor
one more time to the rendering of the original number.
<br/>
<br/>
We can also add two Church numerals:

<pre>
    (define add
        (lambda (a)
            (lambda (b)
                (lambda (f)
                    (lambda (x)
                        ((a f) ((b f) x))    ; ((b f) x) is a rendering of b
                        )
                    )
                )
            )
        )
</pre>

Here, we render the addend <i>b</i> and use that rendering as the base value
for the augend <i>a</i>. Thus, in a rendering of the sum, the original base
value gets incremented <i>b</i> times and then is further incremented <i>a</i>
times, for a total of <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow>	<mi>a</mi>	<mo>+</mo>	<mi>b</mi></mrow></math> increments over the base value.
<br/>
<br/>
Church numerals repeatedly apply a function to a base value. We can
use this fact to run <i>any</i> single-argument function repeatedly
on <i>any</i> value. This is what a multiplication function does:

<pre>

    (define mul
        (lambda (a)
            (lambda (b)
                (lambda (f)
                    (lambda (x)
                        ((((a (add b)) zero) f) x)     ; ((a (add b)) zero) renders a Church numeral
                        )
                    )
                )
            )
        )
</pre>

Here, we render <i>a</i> with a curried version of <i>add</i> on the Church
numeral <i>zero</i>. The <i>add</i> function normally takes two arguments, but
by currying the first argument, we turn in into a one argument
function. If <i>a</i> was the Church numeral <i>one</i>, we would
apply the curried <i>add</i> function once to <i>zero</i>, yielding:

<pre>
    ((add b) zero)
</pre>

which would give us just <i>b</i>. If <i>a</i> was <i>two</i>, we would apply
the curried <i>add</i> function twice:

<pre>
    ((add b) ((add b) zero))
</pre>

If <i>a</i> were <i>three</i>, we'd get:

<pre>
    ((add b) ((add b) ((add b) zero)))
</pre>

Notice in each of these cases, we add in <i>b</i>, starting with <i>zero</i>,
<i>a</i> number of times, yielding the expected product. Once all the
repeated addition is completed, we render the resulting Church numeral
with the incrementor <i>f</i> and base value <i>x</i>.
