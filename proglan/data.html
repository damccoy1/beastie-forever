<h2>
 The cons cell
<br/>
</h2><!-- QA_SEQUENCE -->

There are a number of data structures in Scheme, but
one rises to the forefront due to its simplicity and
usefulness. The structure is known as the <i>cons</i>
<i>cell</i> (or cons object).
A cons
object is simply two pieces of data, or items, glued together. For example,
the expression
(define a (cons 2 3))
binds the name <i>a</i> to the pair 
<code>(2 . 3)</code>.
The dot is used to
signify the glue in the cons object. The object
<br/>

<pre>
    ()
</pre>

is used to signify the empty cons object (and also the empty list,
which is discussed below). The Scam intepreter
the class echos the value of the
empty cons object as:
<br/>

<pre>
    nil
</pre>

Because Scheme obeys the closure property for data structures, a cons
object can be one (or both) of the items in a cons object. For example:
<br/>

<pre>
    (define b (cons 1 (cons 2 3)))
</pre>

binds the name <i>b</i> to the pair 
<code>(1 . (2 . 3))</code>.
A special term
is used if the last item in the last cons object is the empty cons
object. Such a structure is called a list. For example:
<br/>

<pre>
    (define c (cons 1 (cons 2 (cons 3 () ))))
</pre>

binds the name <i>c</i> to a list containing the numbers 1, 2, and 3.
The
list is usually represented as
<br/>

<pre>
    (1 2 3)
</pre>

rather than
<br/>

<pre>
    (1 . (2 . (3 . #f)))
</pre>

although both representation are accurate. Typing the name <i>c</i> to
the interpreter will produce the first representation.
<br/>

<h2>
 Lists
<br/>
</h2><!-- QA_SEQUENCE -->

The function which constructs a list is appropriately called <i>list</i>.
To bind the name <i>a</i> to the list consisting of the numbers 2, 3 and
4, one could execute the following command.
<br/>

<pre>
    (define a (list 2 3 4))
</pre>

Note that list is a multi-arity or variadic procedure.
It can take any number of arguments.
If one were to subsequently type <i>a</i> to the interpreter, it would
return the value
<br/>

<pre>
    (2 3 4)
</pre>

Lists also have literal forms. The following definition of <i>a</i> is
equivalent to the previous.
<br/>

<pre>
    (define a &#39;(2 3 4))
</pre>

The quote mark instructs the interpreter not to evaluate any item in the
list. So while the definitions are equivalent in this case, they are not
equivalent in all cases. For example, consider these definitions:
<br/>

<pre>
    (define x 3)
    (define a &#39;(1 2 x))
    (define b (list 1 2 x))
</pre>

Evaluating <i>a</i> yields:
<br/>

<pre>
    (1 2 x)
</pre>

while evaluating <i>b</i> yields:
<br/>

<pre>
    (1 2 3)
</pre>

The difference is due to list being a normal function which has
its arguments evaluated. Quoting a list with a quote mark is equivalent
to making a call to the function <i>quote</i>. For example:
<br/>

<pre>
    (define z &#39;(2 3 4))
</pre>

is equivalent to:
<br/>

<pre>
    (define z (quote (2 3 4))
</pre>

Note that <i>quote</i> must be a special form.

<h2>
 Dissecting a list
<br/>
</h2><!-- QA_SEQUENCE -->

Scheme has two functions for dissembling pairs or lists. They are <i>car</i>,
which returns the first item in the list, and <i>cdr</i> which returns
the list minus the first element. When applied to cons cells, <i>car</i>
returns the first item in the cell while <i>cdr</i> returns the second item.
Consider this definition
<br/>

<pre>
    (define odds &#39;(1 3 5 7 9))
</pre>

Then consider the following operations on the list odds
<br/>

<pre>
    (car odds)                          ;yields 1
    (cdr odds)                          ;yields the list (3 5 7 9)
    (cdr (cdr odds))                    ;yields the list (5 7 9)
    (car (cdr (cdr (cdr odds))))        ;yields 7
    (cdr (cdr (cdr (cdr (cdr odds)))))  ;yields the empty list ()
    (cdr (car odds)                     ;yields an error
</pre>

It is an error to take the car or the cdr of something that
is not a list or a cons object. It is an error to take the car
or the cdr of an empty list. Scheme allows you to conveniently combine
multiple car and cdr function calls into a single function
call. The last four examples above could have been written as:
<br/>

<pre>
    (cddr odds)
    (cadddr odds)
    (cdddddr odds)
    (cdar odds)
</pre>

respectively. The empty list is the real false value in Scheme; every other
object in MIT Scheme is considered true. Thus
<br/>

<pre>
    (if t 0 1)
</pre>

evaluates to zero if <i>t</i> is an empty list and 1 otherwise.
The predicate
<i>list?</i> is provided to answer the question of whether an item is a
list or not, while the predicate <i>null?</i> is provided to answer the
question whether an item is an empty list or not.

<h2>
 Computing the length of a list
<br/>
</h2><!-- QA_SEQUENCE -->

Here is a procedure to count the number of top-level items in a list. I
say top-level because in actuality, an item in a list may be a list itself..
<br/>

<pre>
    (define (length a)
        (if a
            (+ 1 (length (cdr a)))
            0
            )
        )
</pre>

Note that this function implements an recursive process.
<br/>
<br/>
Here is a version which recursively counts all the non-list items in a
list. This is equivalent to counting all of the leaves in a tree, so I'll
name the function leaves.
<br/>

<pre>
    (define (leaves t)
        (cond
            ((null? t) ;no more leaves in this subtree
                0
                )
            ((list? t)
                (+ (leaves (car t)) (leaves (cdr t)))
                )
            (else ;must be a leaf
                1
                )
            )
        )
</pre>

<h2>
 Procedures as a repository for data
<br/>
</h2><!-- QA_SEQUENCE -->

Consider the following function definition:
<br/>

<pre>
    (define (cons a b)
        (define (extract param)
            (cond
                ((= param 0) a)
                ((= param 1) b)
                (else (throw &#39;consError &quot;bad argument to cons&quot;))
                )
            )
        extract
        )
</pre>

This function builds an internal function (for which the parameters
a and b are in scope). After constructing the extract function,
the cons function returns a pointer to extract. Thus we have changed
the return value of cons from a cons cell to a function.
Now we can write new versions of car and cdr that act on this new
return value of cons:
<br/>

<pre>
    (define (car cell)
        (cell 0)
        )

    (define (cdr cell)
        (cell 1)
        )
</pre>

If one were to drop these functions (cons, car, and cdr) into
a working program already using the original cons, car, and cdr,
the semantics of the program would remain unchanged.
This illustrates that a language with first-class functions
need not supply any data structures at all!
