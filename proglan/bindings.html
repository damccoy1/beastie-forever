 Bound vs. free variables

Consider the problem of determining whether a number was prime or not. A
simplistic way is to divide the putative prime by every number greater than
1 and less than itself. If no divisor divides evenly, then the number is
prime. Here is a function which implements this search:
<br/>

<pre>
    (define (smallest-divisor current n) 
        (if (= (remainder n current) 0) 
            current 
            (smallest-divisor (+ current 1) n) 
            ) 
        )
</pre>

We can use a wrapper function to give us a nice interface to our
searching function:
<br/>

<pre>
    (define (prime? n) 
        (= (smallest-divisor 2 n) n) 
        )
</pre>

However, <i>smallest-divisor</i> is polluting our namespace, so let's restrict
its scope to the wrapper function.
<br/>

<pre>
    (define (prime? n) 
        (define (smallest-divisor current target) 
            (if (= (remainder target current) 0) 
                current 
                (smallest-divisor (+ current 1) target) 
                ) 
            ) 
        (= (smallest-divisor 2 n) n) 
        )
</pre>

There are three variables in this definition of <i>prime?</i>, <i>n</i>,
<i>current</i>, and <i>target</i>. The variable <i>n</i> that is a formal
parameter of <i>prime?</i> is said to be bound with respect to <i>prime?</i>.
The variables <i>current</i> and <i>target</i>, the formal parameters of
<i>smallest-divisor</i>, are said to be bound
with respect to <i>smallest-divisor</i>.
Note that <i>target</i> is always equivalent to <i>n</i>.
Since the two bindings
are identical, we can get by with a single binding with
respect to the outermost
function.
Removing the duplicate binding yields :
<br/>

<pre>
    (define (prime? n) 
        (define (smallest-divisor current) 
            (if (= (remainder n current) 0) 
                current 
                (smallest-divisor (+ current 1)) 
                ) 
            ) 
        (= (smallest-divisor 2) n) 
        )
</pre>

In this case, the variable <i>n</i> is bound with respect to <i>prime?</i>
but free with respect to <i>smallest-divisor</i>.
We will encounter free variables
further along, but at this point you should be able to analyze code to determine
the free and bound variables with respect to a function.
With regards to functions, the name <i>smallest-divisor</i> is bound with
respect to <i>prime?</i> and <i>prime?</i> is bound with respect to the universe.
This is no different than the binding rules in C, C++, and Java.
<br/>
<br/>
Here is code that refers to a variable bound in an outer scope:
<br/>

<pre>
    { 
    int x = 5; 
        { 
        int y = 6; 
        cout &lt;&lt; x + y; 
        // x is visible in the inner scope 
        } 
    }
</pre>
