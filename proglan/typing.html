<h2> Static typing
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

There are two basic approaches to typing found in modern languages,
static typing, which is generally used in languages for mission critical
applications, and dynamic typing, which is generally used in languages for
rapid prototyping and simple task automation (such as shell scripts). In
a statically typed language, type mismatches are discovered at compile time
(or parse time for interpreters). In a dynamically typed language, such errors
are discovered at run time.
<br/>
<br/>
Building an interpreter for a dynamically typed language is quite simple -
one simply ignores type consideration until the last possible moment.
Thus, if a statement in the language tries to combine two objects in
some illegal way, as in:
<br/>

<pre>
    a = x % 4.3;  // modulus valid only for integral types
</pre>

the parser for the interpreter will gladly build a parse tree for
performing modulus with a non-integral divisor. Only when the statement
is executed by the evaluator will the error be uncovered.
<br/>
<!-- section -->
<h2> A Grammar for Types
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

The first step to adding static typing is to modify your
grammar so that all variable definitions have a type.
This includes function definitions as well. For
example, a rule like:
<br/>

<pre>
    varDef : VAR ID ASSIGN expr SEMI
</pre>

would become:
<br/>

<pre>
    varDef : type ID ASSIGN expr SEMI
</pre>

In addition, a rule for defining functions, like:
<br/>

<pre>
    funcDef : function ID OPAREN optParamList CPAREN block
</pre>

would become:
<br/>

<pre>
    funcDef : type ID OPAREN optTypedParamList CPAREN block
</pre>

Note that both <i>varDef</i> and <i>funcDef</i> both start the same, so your
grammar will have to deal with that, but for illustrative
purposes, we will discuss them as separate rules.
We are left with defining the <i>type</i> rule. At first, this seems
to be a simple task:
<br/>

<pre>
    type : INT
         | STR
</pre>

where 
<code>INT</code> denotes the keyword for an integer type specifier and

<code>STR</code> denotes the keyword for a string type specifier.
The problem here is that your functions must be able to take functions
as arguments and return them. These functions need to be typed
as well. Here is one possible typing scheme which extends the previous rule
to allow for function types:
<br/>

<pre>
    type : INT
         | STR
         | OPAREN type COLON optTypeList CPAREN //function type

    optTypeList : *empty*
                | typeList

    typeList : type
             | type COMMA typeList
</pre>

Consider the <i>square</i> function,
which takes an integer and returns an integer.
In a typeless language, it might be defined as
<br/>

<pre>
    function square(x)
        {
        x * x;
        }
</pre>

In our typing scheme, it would be
<br/>

<pre>
    int square(int x)
        {
        x * x;
        }
</pre>

Now consider a function that returns the <i>square</i> function!
Typelessly, it would be:
<br/>

<pre>
    function f()
        {
        square;
        }
</pre>

But using our extended type rule above, it would be:
<br/>

<pre>
    (int:int) f()
        {
        square;
        }
</pre>

Suppose we wish to return a function that composes two given functions
(like the <i>compose</i> function in the book). Here is one possible
definition:
<br/>

<pre>
    (int:int) compose((int:int) f,(int:int) g)
        {
        int both(int x)
            {
            f(g(x));
            }
        both;
        }
</pre>

Suppose the <i>zorp</i> function returned the <i>compose</i> function. Its
definition would be:
<br/>

<pre>
    ((int:int):(int:int),(int:int)) zorp()
        {
        compose;
        }
</pre>

As you can see, keeping up with types when doing functional-style programming
can be rather tedious.
<br/>
<!-- section -->
<h2> Keeping track of types
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

After adding the syntax,
actually checking to make sure types match boils down to
keeping track of variables and their types with an <i>environment</i>.
We did something very similar when <a href="undefined.html">
detecting undefined variables
</a> at parse time.
For static typing,
every variable (including variables bound to functions)
are inserted into an environment with its <i>type</i> as its value.
<br/>
<br/>
To begin, nearly every parsing routine is now passed an environment.
Consider a parsing function for a simple variable definition:
<br/>

<pre>
    // varDef : type ID ASSIGN expr SEMI
    function varDef(env)
        {
        var varType;
        var name,value;

        varType = type();
        name = match(ID);
        match(ASSIGN);
        value = expr(env);
        match(SEMI);

        insert(name,varType,env);

        return cons(VARDEF,name,value);
        }
</pre>

The environmental <i>insert</i> function places the variable name and its type
in the hash table at the head of the chain, since we have
just defined a local variable.
<br/>
<br/>
Note that we are using a typed <i>cons</i> function. It returns
a lexeme whose left pointer is the name and whose right
pointer is the initialization expression and whose type
is 
<code>VARDEF</code>.
<br/>
<br/>
The modification for a function definition is similar,
except the environment is extended prior to parsing the body:
<br/>

<pre>
    // funcDef : type ID OPAREN optTypedParamList CPAREN block
    function funcDef(env)
        {
        var name,params,body;
        var returnType;
        var xenv;

        returnType = type();
        name = match(ID);
        match(OPAREN);
        params = optTypedParamList();
        match(CPAREN);

        insert(name,makeFuncType(returnType,extractTypes(params)),env);

        xenv = extend(extractNames(params),extractTypes(params),env);

        body = block(xenv);

        return cons(FUNCDEF,name,cons(NO_TYPE,params,body));
        }
</pre>

Note that any time a block is encountered, the environment needs to
be extended, since local definitions may occur in the block.
The environmental <i>extend</i> function
takes a list of variables and a parallel
list of types, builds a new frame from the two lists, and
returns an environment with the new frame at the head.
<br/>
<br/>
For example, suppose we are parsing the <i>urp</i> function:
<br/>

<pre>
    int urp(int x,int y)
        {
        x * y;
        }
</pre>

At the point where we call the <i>insert</i> function,
<i>name</i> is bound to
<i>urp</i> and <i>returnType</i> is bound to 
<code>INT</code>.
The variable <i>params</i> is
bound to the list containing 
<code>int x,int y</code> (in some form).
The function
<i>extractTypes</i> should return the list
containing 
<code>int,int</code> (in some form).
The function <i>makeFuncType</i> should return 
<code>(int:int,int)</code>
(in some form).
Moreover, and this is very important: the structure
returned by <i>makeFuncType</i> should match exactly the
structure returned by the <i>type</i> parsing function
if it encountered the type:
<br/>

<pre>
    (int:int,int)
</pre>

in the source code.
<br/>
After inserting the type of the function into the environment,
the environment is extended. This extension models the
static scoping of the language. As you recall for evaluating
function calls,
the extended environment is populated with the formal
parameters and their values.
In this case,
the value of a formal parameter is its type.
Under this extended environment,
the body of the function definition is parsed.
<br/>
<br/>
Finally, the function object is created and
returned.
Since these are the only places variables are given types, we are
done with the &lsquo;keeping track&rsquo; part. What's left is the &lsquo;checking
that types match&rsquo; part.
<br/>
<!-- section -->
<h2> Checking that all types match
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

The last stage of the implementation of static typing is
to make sure that all expressions are typed and that
when the parse trees of expressions are combined,
type violations are reported.
<br/>
<br/>
This presents a bit of a quandary.
The recursive descent parsing functions
must return parse trees, but now they
must return the types of those parse
trees as well.
A simple solution is to add a new
field to the lexemes that make up
the parse trees. We will call
that field <i>resultType</i>, to distinguish
it from the <i>type</i> field of the lexeme.
Now, every parse tree will have
<i>resultType</i> set to the type
of the overall expression that the
parse tree represents.
The field <i>resultType</i> should point
to a lexeme in order for the
type matching routine (see below)
to function properly.
<br/>
<!-- subsection -->
<h3> Typing primaries
<br/>
</h3><!-- subsection ENDED -->

Since all expression parse trees start
with <i>unary</i>, we modify the <i>unary</i>
parse function to set <i>returnType</i>.
<br/>

<pre>
    function unary(env)
        {
        var result;

        if (check(INTEGER))
            {
            result = match(INTEGER);
            result . resultType = new Lexeme(INT);
            }
        else if (check(STRING))
            {
            result = match(STRING);
            result . resultType = new Lexeme(STR);
            }
        else if (check(ID))
            {
            result = match(ID);
            result . resultType = lookup(result,env);
            if (check(OPAREN))
                {
                //process function call
                ...
                }
            }
        //other primaries
        ...
        
        return result;
        }
</pre>

Recall that 
<code>INTEGER</code> is the type of an integer lexeme,
while 
<code>INT</code> is the type of the integer type specifier
in the target language.
<br/>
<br/>
Note that the code for identifiers is where we
see the type environment come into play.
The lookup routine serves two purposes.
The first purpose is to detect undefined
variables. If the variable just parsed is
not in the type environment,
then it is considered undefined.
The second purpose is to retrieve the
type of the variable that was stored in
the environment when the variable was
declared. In our example language,
the type would be an 
<code>INT</code> or a 
<code>STR</code>
or a function type.
<br/>
<br/>
The next unary we tackle is function
call. Here, we have to
ensure the identifier is actually bound to
a function and that the argument types
match the defined types of the formal parameters.
<br/>

<pre>
    if (check(ID))
        {
        var idtype;
        result = match(ID);
        idtype = lookup(result,env);
        if (check(OPAREN))
            {
            var returnType;
            ensureFunction(result);
            returnType = extractReturnType(idtype);
            match(OPAREN);
            args = optArgList(env);
            match(CPAREN);
            matchTypes(extractParamTypes(idtype),extractArgTypes(args));
            result = cons(CALL,result,args);
            result . resultType = returnType;
            }
        else
            result . resultType = idtype;
        }
</pre>

Once the 
<code>check(OPAREN)</code>
confirms that this is truly a function call,
we use 
<code>ensureFunction</code>
to ensure that the identifier will be bound
to a function.
The <i>ensureFunction</i> routine, need only check that
the given cons cell has type FUNCTYPE.
<br/>
<br/>
Next we extract and save the return type of the
function as that will be the type of the
overall function call parse tree.
<br/>
<br/>
After parsing the arguments, the <i>matchTypes</i> routine
is called to compare the lists of types that <i>extractParamTypes</i>
and <i>extractArgTypes</i> return. They must match exactly.
If they do not, a fatal
error can be generated at this point.
<br/>
<br/>
Finally, the call parse tree is constructed and typed
with the return type of the function.
<br/>
<br/>
Other primaries, such as parenthesized expressions,
are left to the student.
<br/>
<!-- subsection -->
<h3> Typing expressions
<br/>
</h3><!-- subsection ENDED -->

Primaries (and expressions) are joined together by the expression rule.
Here, the compatibility of the pieces being joined together is
examined and the resulting parse tree is given a type.
A data-directed approach is ideal for this application:
<br/>

<pre>
    function expr(env)
        {
        var root,left,right;
        
        left = unary(env);
        if (opPending())
            {
            root = op();
            right = expr(env);
            root . resultType =
                get(root . type,left . resultType,right . resultType);
            root . left = left;
            root . right = right;
            }
        else
            root = left;

        return root;
        }
</pre>

The <i>get</i> function examines a table loaded with triples

<code>(operator,type,type)</code>,
with each triple associated with a resulting type. The resulting
type is returned by <i>get</i>. If get can't find a matching triple,
it reports a type error and ends execution.
<br/>
<br/>
For example, if the table is loaded with:
<br/>

<pre>
    (+,int,int) -&gt; int
</pre>

this means that an integer added to an integer yields an
integer. If this is the only entry in the table, the
source code fragment:
<br/>

<pre>
    &quot;hello&quot; + &quot;, world&quot;
</pre>

would generate a type error.
<br/>
<!-- subsection -->
<h3> Checking function definitions
<br/>
</h3><!-- subsection ENDED -->

Another important type check is
to make sure the value returned by a function
matches the return value specified by the
function definition. Here is a modified
version of <i>funcDef</i> that does just that:
<br/>

<pre>
    // funcDef : type ID OPAREN optTypedParamList CPAREN block
    function funcDef(env)
        {
        var name,params,body;
        var returnType;
        var xenv;

        returnType = type();
        name = match(ID);
        match(OPAREN);
        params = optTypedParamList();
        match(CPAREN);

        insert(name,makeFuncType(returnType,extractTypes(params)),env);

        xenv = extend(extractNames(params),extractTypes(params),env);

        body = block(xenv);

        matchType(block.resultType,returnType);

        return cons(FUNCDEF,name,cons(NO_TYPE,params,body));
        }
</pre>

For this to work, the type of the last statement
in the block has to percolate up to be the result
type of the block's root note:
<br/>

<pre>
    function block(env)
        {
        var root,item;

        item = statement(env);
        if (statementPending())
            {
            root = cons(BLOCK,item,block(env));
            root.resultType = cdr(root).resultType;
            }
        else
            {
            root = cons(BLOCK,item,null);
            root.resultType = car(root).resultType;
            }
        return root;
        }
</pre>

There are other places where type checks and tags need to be performed:
<br/>

<ul>

<li>

 the <i>test</i> expression for 
<code>if</code> statements
</li>

<li>

 if an 
<code>if</code> statement has both a true clause and a false clause,
the result types of those clauses must match
</li>

<li>

 the 
<code>if</code> expression itself needs to be tagged
</li>

<li>

 the <i>test</i> expression for 
<code>while</code> loops
</li>

<li>

 the 
<code>while</code> expression itself needs to be tagged (if the grammar
promotes 
<code>while</code>s to first class status
</li>

<li>

 any other unary operations
</li>

</ul>
