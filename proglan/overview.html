The process of building a language interpreter for a fully functioning language
seems intimidating, especially for students who have taken only two
or three CS classes. Yet, the whole process can be broken down into
five steps, each of which builds simply and logically on the previous
step. It is here that you will begin to appreciate the difference between
programming and computer science. To hack out an interpreter without
benefit of the science in computer science may well be an overwhelming
task. With the science, each step can be easily and quickly implemented
by intermediate level programmers. The five steps are
<br/>

<ul>

<li>

 designing
</li>

<li>

 scanning
</li>

<li>

 recognizing
</li>

<li>

 pretty printing
</li>

<li>

 evaluating
</li>

</ul>


In the <i>designing</i> phase, you will develop a grammar for you language. The
grammar specifies how you say things, such as defining and calling a
function, in your language.
<br/>
In the <i>scanning</i> phase, you will break up source code into the individual
words in the language and identify those words as to their types:
keywords, variables, operators and so on.
<br/>
In the <i>recognizing</i> phase, you will use your grammar to build a series
of parsing functions, which step through the words generated by the
scanning phase, in order to determine if the words have been placed in
their proper order.
<br/>
In the <i>pretty-printing</i> phase, you will convert the parsing functions
implemented in the recognizing phase so that they produce parse trees
which reflect the structure of the expressions in the source code. You
will then regenerate the input as a check on how well you understand
the parse trees you have built.
<br/>
In the <i>evaluating</i> phase, you will modify the pretty printer so that
instead of printing the parse trees, you will execute the expressions
contained in those parse trees. You will also use a simple data structure
to store the values of variables currently in scope.
<br/>
At this point, your language will be up and running!
