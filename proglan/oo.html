<h2>
 Object orientation

</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

An object oriented language provides for encapsulation, inheritance, and
polymorphism. First, we focus on encapsulation.
<br/>
<!-- section -->
<h2>
 Encapsulation
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

Recall that in Scheme,
one can encapsulate by returning a dispatch function,
which essentially serves
as an intermediary between the user of the &ldquo;object&rdquo; and the local
environment where the instance variables and methods are stored.
The dispatch function
translates messages to function calls and variable
accesses.
With Scam, one dispenses with the dispatch function and lets the user
of the object deal with the local environment directly. It does so
by revising
the <i>evalFuncCall</i> function to insert a variable
named <i>this</i> whose value is the local environment.
Note
that the local environment is the extended environment under which the
body of the function is evaluated:
<br/>

<pre>
    function evalFuncCall(t,env)
        {
        var closure = eval(getFuncCallName(t),env);
        var args = getFuncCallArgs(t);
        var params = getClosureParams(closure);
        var body = getClosureBody(closure);
        var senv = getClosureEnvironment(closure);
        var eargs = evalArgs(args,env);
        var xenv = EnvExtend(senv,params,eargs);
        
        //insert a variable that points to xenv
        EnvInsert(xenv, new Lexeme(ID,&quot;this&quot;), xenv);

        return eval(body,xenv);
        }
</pre>

Now functions can return the local environment. Here is a simple <i>node</i>
class written in the same style as our pseudocode:
<br/>

<pre>
    function node(value,next)
        {
        this;
        }

    var n = node(5, null);
</pre>

The variable <i>n</i> is bound to the return value of the function,
which is the local environment in which <i>value</i> and <i>next</i> are bound.
This environment is also known as an <i>object</i>.
Functions that return this are known as constructors as well as
classes.
<br/>
<br/>
What
is needed now is a way to access the local variables contained in
an object. Assume the <i>dot</i>
operator performs this function, as in:
<br/>

<pre>
    println(n . value);
</pre>

The left hand side of the dot operator should evaluate to an object,
while the right hand side should be a variable name. Here is a version
of <i>evalDot</i> which treats the expression as a value (rather than as
a place to assign):
<br/>

<pre>
    //precondition: lhs evals to object, rhs is a variable
    function evalDot(t, env)
        {
        var object = eval(getLHS(t), env);
        return eval(getRHS(t), object); // objects == environments!
        }
</pre>

One has to update the assignment operator to handle the case when the dot operator expression is used as a location:
<br/>

<pre>
    function evalAssignment(t, env)
        {
        var result = eval(getRHS(t),env);
        if (getLHS(t).type == VARIABLE)
            EnvUpdate(env,getLHS(t),result);
        else if (getLHS(t).type == DOT)
            {
            var object = eval(getLHS(getLHS(t)),env);
            EnvUpdate(object,getLHS(getRHS(t)),result);
            }
        else
            fatal(&quot;bad assignment!&quot;);

        return result;
        }
</pre>

With these changes, your language has added encapsulation to its feature
set.

<!-- section -->
<h2>
 Adding inheritance
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

Inheritance can be handled using functions written in your language by
manipulating the static scopes of your objects and their methods.
Let:
<br/>
<span class="indent">
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow>	<mi>A</mi>	<mo>&rarr;</mo>	<mi>B</mi>	<mo>&rarr;</mo>	<mi>C</mi>	<mo>&rarr;</mo>	<mi>D</mi></mrow></math>
</span>

<br/>
be an inheritance hierarchy with <i>A</i> being the most sub-class
(the <i>child</i>
class) and
<i>D</i> being the most super class.
Assume, in addition to the constructors <i>A</i> through <i>D</i>, we
have the built-in functions <i>getEnclosingScope</i> and <i>setEnclosingScope</i> with
semantics suggested by their names.
Let's also assume we have four objects <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, and <i>d</i>
which are objects
created by constructors <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, <i>C</i>, and <i>D</i>, respectively.
<br/>
<br/>
To implement the inheritance hierarchy, we need to perform the
following actions:
<br/>
<ol type="i">

<li>

 set the enclosing scope of <i>d</i> to the enclosing scope of <i>a</i>
</li>

<li>

 set the enclosing scope of <i>a</i> to <i>b</i>,
<i>b</i> to <i>c</i>, and <i>c</i> to <i>d</i>
</li>

<li>

 set the definition pointers of the function objects/closures
contained in <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, and <i>d</i> to <i>a</i>
</li>

</ol>


What step 2 does is to allow us to reference functions and variables
defined in <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, and <i>d</i> from <i>a</i>.
Suppose we wish to reference a variable <i>g</i> via <i>a</i>, as in:
<br/>

<pre>
    a . g;
</pre>

If <i>a</i> does not contain a binding for <i>g</i>, then its enclosing scope is
checked. Since the enclosing scope of <i>a</i> has been set to <i>b</i>,
<i>b</i> is then searched, then <i>c</i>, and then <i>d</i>. By virtue of step 1,
the original enclosing scope of <i>a</i> is searched if a binding
for <i>g</i> is not found in any of the objects.
<br/>
<br/>
Step 3 is required so that variables referenced in
functions defined in the super classes
always refer to definitions in the most base class. For example, suppose all
four objects, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, and <i>d</i>,
define a function named <i>f</i>. Suppose further that <i>d</i> defines
a function <i>g</i> that calls a function <i>f</i>. When the hierarchy is
completed, consider a call to <i>g</i> via <i>a</i>:
<br/>

<pre>
    h = a . g;
    h();
</pre>

Since <i>g</i> calls <i>f</i>, with many candidates for <i>f</i>,
whose version of <i>f</i> should <i>g</i> call? In most modern languages,
<i>a</i>&apos;s version is the desired version. By virtue of step three,
the definition environment of <i>g</i> has been switched from <i>d</i> to <i>a</i>.
Thus, the new environment that comes into being from calling <i>g</i> will
point to <i>a</i>. When the variable <i>f</i> needs to be resolved, <i>a</i>
will
be the first place a binding for <i>f</i> will be found. Without this step,
<i>d</i>&apos;s version of <i>f</i> would be found instead when the body of <i>g</i>
is executed.

<h2>
 Generalizing the construction of inheritance hierarchies
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

Scam has a function named <i>mixin</i> that is found in <i>inherit.lib</i>.
The <i>mixin</i> function can be used to
create the hierarchy in the previous section by making the following call:
<br/>

<pre>
    a = mixin(list(A(),B(),C(),D()));
</pre>

where the list function collects the given items in a list.
The calls to <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, <i>C</i>, and <i>D</i>,
create the objects referred to by
<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, and <i>d</i> in the previous section.
<br/>
<br/>
The <i>mixin</i> function might something like this
in our pseudocode:
<br/>

<pre>
    function mixin(objects)
        {
        var child = car(objects);
        setEnclosingScope(last(objects),child);          ;step 1
        chainScopes(child,cdr(objects));                 ;step 2
        setDefinitionScopes(cdr(objects),child);         ;step 3
        child;
        }
</pre>

Note that the <i>mixin</i> function is written in your language, not
the host language, and that it uses the built-in functions
<i>car</i>, <i>cdr</i>, and <i>setEnclosingScope</i> (which are
implemented in your host language).
<br/>
<br/>
The first expression after the definition of <i>child</i> implements
step 1 of the previous section. The <i>chainScopes</i> function implements
step 2 and looks something like:
<br/>

<pre>
    function chainScopes(first,rest)
        {
        while (rest != NULL)
            {
            setEclosingScope(first,car(rest));
            chainScopes(car(first),cdr(rest));
            rest = cdr(rest);
            }
        }
</pre>

It is also written in your language.
Finally, the <i>setDefinitionScopes</i> function implements step 3:
<br/>

<pre>
    function setDefinitionScopes(scopes,child)
        {
        while (scopes != NULL)
            {
            var current = car(scopes);
            var vars = getLocalVariables(current);   
            var vals = getLocalValues(current);
            while (valid? vars)
                {
                if (closure?(car(vars)))
                    {
                    setDefiningScope(car(vars),child);
                    }
                vars  = cdr(vars);
                vals  = cdr(vals);
                }
            scopes = cdr(scopes);
            }
        }
</pre>

where the <i>closure?</i> predicate determines whether or not
a variable value is a function object/closure and
where <i>setDefiningScope</i> resets the definition scope pointer
of a single function object/closure. The actual implementation
of <i>setDefiningScope</i> is dependent on the structure of
the object/closure.
The functions <i>car</i>, <i>cdr</i>,
<i>setDefiningScope</i>,
<i>getLocalVariables</i>, and <i>getLocalValues</i>
are built-in, implemented in your host language.

<h2>
 Generating implicit hierarchies
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

The <i>mixin</i> function requires that the inheritance hierarchy be
explicitly passed. One can provide for an implicit generation
of the hierarchy by requiring object to define a <i>parent</i> pointer.
For example, the definition of <i>A</i> might be look like:
<br/>

<pre>
    (define (A)
        (define parent (B))
        ...
        this
        )
</pre>

The definition of <i>B</i> would likewise contain a parent pointer that
points to an object constructed by <i>C</i> and so on.
With the parent pointers in place, one simply needs to pass an
<i>A</i> object to a function that extracts the inheritance hierarchy by
following the parent pointers. This function
then passes the resulting chain of
objects to <i>mixin</i>. Scam calls this function <i>new</i> and
it could be implemented as:
<br/>

<pre>
    function new(child)
        {
        var chain = followParentPointers(child);
        mixin(chain);
        child;
        }
</pre>

The <i>followParentPointers</i> function might look like:
<br/>

<pre>
    function followParentPointers(current)
        {
        if (current == NULL)
            {
            &quot;ok&quot;;
            }
        else
            {
            cons(current,followParentPointers(current . parent));
            }
        }
</pre>

where <i>cons</i> is a built-in function.
Note that the parent pointers serve as alternative way to specify that
one class inherits from another (as with <i>extends</i> in Java), but without
the burden of additional syntax.

<h2>
 Polymorphism

Since your language is dynamically, not statically typed, polymorphism
comes for free and you do not need to do anything else to
implement it.
