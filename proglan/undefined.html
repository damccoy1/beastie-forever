<h2>
 Undefined Variables

<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

Suppose you have an undefined variable in the source code your
language intrepreter is evaluating.
Typically, what happens is when the
evaluator requires the value of a variable, it calls the environmental
<i>lookup</i> routine. The <i>lookup</i> function signals an error when
it cannot find the variable in question. We say the undefined variable
was detected at <i>run</i> <i>time</i>.
<br/>
<br/>
An alternative approach is to detect the undefined variable at
<i>parse</i> <i>time</i>. If your language requires explicit declarations
of variables, the task of identifying such variables is rather
straightforward.
One only needs to detect and store the variable declarations
as the parser descends into the source code.
<br/>
<!-- section -->
<h2>
 Keeping track of variables declarations
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

One can use an <i>environment</i> to monitor all variable declarations.
When a variable is declared, the name of the variable is inserted into the
current environment. When a function is defined, the name of
the function is placed in the currented environment
while an extended environment
is used to corral the formal parameters and
the local variables encountered when parsing
the function body.
<br/>
<br/>
To begin, nearly every parsing routine is now passed a <i>declaration</i>
environment.
Consider a parsing function for a simple variable definition:
<br/>

<pre>
    // varDef : VAR ID ASSIGN expr SEMI
    function varDef(env)
        {
        var name,value;

        match(VAR);
        name = match(ID);
        match(ASSIGN);
        value = expr(env);
        match(SEMI);

        insert(name,PRESENT,env);       //add ID to the declaration env

        return cons(VARDEF,name,value); //parse tree
        }
</pre>

The environmental <i>insert</i> function places the variable name and a dummy
value
in the local frame of the declaration environment,
corresponding to the fact that we just defined a local variable.
<br/>
<br/>
Note that we are using a typed <i>cons</i> function. It returns
a lexeme whose left pointer is the name and whose right
pointer is the initialization expression and whose type
is 
<code>VARDEF</code>.
<br/>
<br/>
The modification for a function definition is similar,
except the environment is extended prior to parsing the body:
<br/>

<pre>
    // funcDef : FUNCTION ID OPAREN optParamList CPAREN block
    function funcDef(env)
        {
        var name,params,body;
        var xenv;

        match(FUNCTION);
        name = match(ID);
        match(OPAREN);
        params = optParamList();
        match(CPAREN);

        insert(name,PRESENT,env); // add function name to env

        xenv = extend(params,params,env); //values don&#39;t matter, use params

        body = block(xenv);

        return cons(FUNCDEF,name,cons(JOIN,params,body));
        }
</pre>

Note that anytime a block is encountered, the environment needs to
be extended since local definitions may occur in the block.
The environmental <i>extend</i> function takes a list of variables
and a parallel list of types, adding a new frame to the existing
environment. Note that the original environment is unaffected,
a requirement since we cannot have the local variables polluting the
calling environment.
<br/>
<br/>
As an example, suppose we are parsing the <i>urp</i> function:
<br/>

<pre>
    function urp(x,y)
        {
        var z = x - y;
        x * y * z;
        }
</pre>

The name <i>urp</i> is inserted into the current declaration environment
while the formal parameters and, ultimately, the local
variable <i>z</i> are inserted into an extension of the declaration environment.
Note how this parallels function <i>calls</i> when evaluating,
wherein
the extended environment is populated with the formal
parameters and their values.
In this case,
the value of a formal parameter doesn't matter, we
just need it to be present in the extended environment
when the body of the function definition is parsed.
<br/>
<br/>
Since variable declarations and function definitions
(function names and formal parameters) are the only
places variables are declared,
we are
done with the ``keeping track<i> part.
What's left is the ``checking
that variables are previously declared</i> part.
<br/>
<!-- section -->
<h2>
 Checking for previous declarations
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

The last stage of the implementation of undefined variable detection
is to look up every occurrence of a variable (other than in
the declarations mentioned previously). If the variable is
present in the current environment, everything is copacetic.
If not, then no declaration for that variable was encountered
on the path to the current spot in the parser and an
undefined variable can be signaled.
<br/>
<br/>
Since any other mention of a variable is in the <i>primary</i> rule,
we modify <i>primary</i> to make the check:
<br/>

<pre>
    function primary(env)
        {
        var result;

        if (check(INTEGER))
            return match(INTEGER);
        else if (check(STRING))
            return match(STRING);
        else if (check(ID))
            {
            lookup(Pending,env); //throws exception if not found
            result = match(ID);
            if (check(OPAREN))
                {
                //process function call
                ...
                }
            return result;
            }
        //other primaries
            ...
        
        }
</pre>

At this point, your parser should detect undefined variables.
<br/>
<!-- section -->
<h2>
 Mutually recursive functions
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

A consequence of detecting undefined variables is that
all variables be declared before
they are used. Sometimes, however, this rule cannot be
enforced by the code.
Consider two mutually recursive functions:
<br/>

<pre>
    function f(x)
        {
        if (x &lt; 2) { return x; }
        else { return g(x + 1) * x; }
        }
    
    function g(y)
        {
        if (y &lt; 2) { return y; }
        else { return f(y - 2) * x; }
        }
</pre>

When parsing the body of <i>f</i>, we encounter a reference to the
variable <i>g</i>, which has not yet been declared. Likewise, if
we place the definition of <i>g</i> prior to that of <i>f</i> to fix this
problem, we generate a second problem. Namely, now <i>f</i> is referenced
in the body of <i>g</i> but now <i>f</i> is not yet declared.
<br/>
<br/>
Many languages solve this problem by using some sort of <i>forward</i>
statement. A forward statement is processed just like any other
variable declaration:
<br/>

<pre>
    forward g; // g will be declared later

    function f(x)
        {
        if (x &lt; 2) { return x; }
        else { return g(x + 1) * x; }
        }
    
    function g(y)
        {
        if (y &lt; 2) { return y; }
        else { return f(y - 2) * x; }
        }
</pre>

Typically, you would insert a forward variable with a distinct value
into the environment:
<br/>

<pre>
    // FORWARD ID SEMI
    function forward(env)
        {
        var result,name;
        
        result = match(FORWARD);
        name = match(ID);
        insert(name,newLexeme(FORWARD),env);
        match(SEMI);

        return result;
        }
</pre>

Now, when inserting the actual definition of a forward variable
in the local frame, you would update the value of the variable
from 
<code>FORWARD</code> to 
<code>PRESENT</code>.
By doing the update, you can check for unresolved forward declarations in
the local frame after parsing function bodies and after
returning from the start rule.
