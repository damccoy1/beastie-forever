 Introduction

</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

The set of rules that tell you whether a sentence is correctly structured
is called a <i>grammar</i>. Here is a simple, and very incomplete, grammar
for English:
<br/>

<pre>
    sentence : nounPhrase verbPhrase PERIOD
    nounPhrase : ARTICLE Adjective NOUN
    verbPhrase : VERB nounPhrase
</pre>

Given these nouns,
<br/>

<pre>
    cow
    water
    dog
</pre>

these articles,
<br/>

<pre>
    the
    a
</pre>

these verbs,
<br/>

<pre>
    drank
    chased
</pre>

and these adjectives,
<br/>

<pre>
    large
    cool
    yappy
</pre>

we can generate a number of syntactically correct sentences, such as:
<br/>

<pre>
    The large cow drank the cool water.
    A yappy dog chased the large cow.
    The cool water chased the cool dog.
    The yappy water drank a large cow.
</pre>

Grammars can also be used to recognize syntactically correct
sentences. For example, the sentence:
<br/>

<pre>
    A large dog drank the cool water.
</pre>

can be fit to the grammar above in the following way:
<br/>
<span class="indent">
<image src="parse.jpg">

</span>

<br/>
Note that the grammar above does not allow for the sentence:
<br/>

<pre>
    The large yappy dog drank the water.
</pre>

since the grammar requires a single adjective in a noun phrase. We can
modify the grammar to allow sentences of this form (and still allow for
the sentences that were allowed before modification):
<br/>

<pre>
    sentence : nounPhrase verbPhrase PERIOD
    nounPhrase : ARTICLE adjList NOUN
    verbPhrase : VERB nounPhrase
    adjList : ADJECTIVE | ADJECTIVE adjList
</pre>

We can also allow for sentences like:
<br/>

<pre>
    The dog drank water.
</pre>

with a further modification:
<br/>

<pre>
    sentence : nounPhrase verbPhrase PERIOD
    nounPhrase : optArticle optAdjList NOUN
    verbPhrase : VERB nounPhrase
    optArticle : ARTICLE | *empty*
    optAdjList : adjList | *empty*
    adjList : ADJECTIVE | ADJECTIVE adjList
</pre>

<h2>
 Semantics
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

Syntax tells you if the sentence is constructed correctly. Semantics tells
you whether a correctly structured sentence makes any sense. The sentence:
<br/>

<pre>
    The box drank water
</pre>

is correct syntactically speaking
(subject then verb then object) but seems wrong since boxes don't drink.
<br/>
Semantics is handled in the <i>evaluation</i> stage.
