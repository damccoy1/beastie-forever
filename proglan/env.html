<h2>
 Implementing Environments and Scope

<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

Recall that the purpose of an environment is two fold: to hold the
bindings between variables and their current values and to
implement scope.
<br/>
<br/>
There are five basic operations on environments:

<ul>

<li>

 create
</li>

<li>

 lookup
</li>

<li>

 update
</li>

<li>

 insert
</li>

<li>

 extend
</li>

</ul>


One possibility for implementing environments is to store the variables
and values in a particular environment as two parallel lists. Normally,
such an approach is not ideal due to the possibility that the
parallel arrays getting out of sync. However, we will see
that using parallel arrays allows us to implement function calls
very efficiently.
<br/>
<br/>
Continuing our standard approach of using <i>Lexeme</i> objects for
just about everything, we will implement environments with lexemes. We
postulate (as before) the existence of <i>cons</i>, <i>car</i>, <i>cdr</i>,
<i>setCar</i> and <i>setCdr</i> functions. The basic environment routines
are rather straightforward. Since environments need to point to other
environments, we will model an environment structure as a list of parallel
lists. The first two lists in an environment structure correspond to the
variables and values in the innermost scope. The next two lists will be
the variables and values in the nearest outer scope, and so on.
<br/>
<!-- section -->
<h2>
 Creating environment structures
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

Because an environment structure is a list of parallel lists,
an new environment structure has no bindings and thus can
be represented by two empty lists in a list:
<br/>

<pre>
    function create()
        {
        return cons(ENV,null,cons(VALUES,null,null));
        }
</pre>

Note that we are using a typed <i>cons</i> function. It returns
a lexeme whose left pointer is the second argument and whose right
pointer is the third argument and whose type
is the first argument.
<br/>
<br/>
Chapter 4 of the textbook uses a slightly different approach. It treats
a scope/table as single node which glues together the list of variable
and the lists of values. These scopes or tables are then collected
into a linked list. Under this scenario, <i>create</i> becomes:
<br/>

<pre>
    function create()
        {
        return cons(ENV,cons(VALUES,null,null),null);
        }
</pre>

<br/>
Either method works well, but the former is a little bit simpler.
<br/>

<h2>
 Looking up and updating the value of a variable
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

Finding the value of a variable simply means looking
up a variable/value in the first two lists of an
environment structure. If it is not there, we
lookup the variable in the next two lists and so on:
<br/>

<pre>
    function lookup(variable,env)
        {
        while (env != null)
            {
            vars = car(env);
            vals = cadr(env);
            while (vars != null)
                {
                if (sameVariable(variable,car(vars)))
                    {
                    return car(vals);
                    }
                vars = cdr(vars);
                vals = cdr(vals);
                }
            env = cdr(cdr(env));
            }

        Fatal(&quot;variable &quot;,variable,&quot; is undefined&quot;);

        return null;
        }
</pre>

The <i>update</i> function is similar, only <i>setCar</i> is used to set
the appropriate car pointer of the values list.
<br/>
<br/>
Using the Chapter 4 scenario, <i>lookup</i> becomes:
<br/>

<pre>
    function lookup(variable,env)
        {
        while (env != null)
            {
            table = car(env);
            vars = car(table);
            vals = cdr(table);
            while (vars != null)
                {
                if (sameVariable(variable,car(vars)))
                    {
                    return car(vals);
                    }
                vars = cdr(vars);
                vals = cdr(vals);
                }
            env = cdr(env);
            }

        Fatal(&quot;variable &quot;,variable,&quot; is undefined&quot;);

        return null;
        }
</pre>

As expected, the differences between the two versions are slight.
<br/>
<br/>

<h2>
 Inserting a new variable into the local environment
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

A variable is inserted into the local environment any time
a simple variable is declared or a function defined. Note
that the local environment is represented as the first two
parallel lists in a list of environments. This makes the
task quite easy:
<br/>

<pre>
    function insert(variable,value,env)
        {
        setCar(env,cons(JOIN,variable,car(env)));
        setCar(cdr(env),cons(JOIN,value,cadr(env)));
        return value;
        }
</pre>

Notice that the new variable and its value are put on the
front of the parallel lists, since this placement is much
faster than placing them at the end of the parallel lists.
The JOIN type is used when there is no need to give the
<i>cons</i> cell a specific type.
The added advantage of this placement is that redefinitions
in the same scope shadow previous definitions.
<br/>
<br/>
Under the Chapter 4 scenario, <i>insert</i> becomes:
<br/>

<pre>
    function insert(variable,value,env)
        {
        table = car(env);
        setCar(table,cons(JOIN,variable,car(table)));
        setCdr(table,cons(JOIN,value,cdr(table)));
        return value;
        }
</pre>

<!-- section -->
<h2>
 Extending an environment
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

The last environment routine is <i>extension</i>. This is the
step is performed for a function call;
a new environment is created, populated with
the local parameters and values, and finally pointed to the
defining environment. The populating step is performed
by <i>cons</i>-ing on a list of variables and a list of values
onto the environment list containing the defining environment:
<br/>

<pre>
    function extend(variables,values,env)
        {
        return cons(ENV,variables,cons(ENV,values,env));
        }
</pre>

Under the Chapter 4 scenario, <i>extend</i> becomes:
<br/>

<pre>
    function extend(variables,values,env)
        {
        return cons(ENV,cons(VALUES,variables,values),env));
        }
</pre>

Note that <i>create</i> can be written in terms of <i>extend</i>:
<br/>

<pre>
    function create()
        {
        return extend(nil,nil,nil);
        }
</pre>
