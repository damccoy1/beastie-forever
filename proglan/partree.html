<h2>
 Parse trees

<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

Recall that the implementation of a grammar is called a <i>parser</i>. Recall
also that a parser which skims through the input in order to see that the
input is made of good sentences is designated a <i>recognizer</i>. A recognizer
can be extended to format the input in a nicer or standard fashion. Such
a program is called a <i>pretty</i> <i>printer</i>. However,
in order to pretty print,the
structure of the input sentences must somehow be preserved. An easy way
to do this is to build a parse tree.
<br/>
<br/>
Consider the implementation of the following right associative grammar
as a recognizer:
<br/>

<pre>
    expression : primary op expression | primary

    op : PLUS | MINUS | TIMES | DIVIDE

    primary : VARIABLE | NUMBER | OPAREN expression CPAREN | MINUS primary
</pre>

The function corresponding to <i>expression</i> is..
<br/>

<pre>
    function expression()
        {
        primary();
        if (opPending())
            {
            op();
            expression();
            }
        }
</pre>

Note that while the <i>expression</i> function
enforces the proper structure of an expression,
it does not save the source code; all the lexemes are thrown away. In order
to save the lexemes and to combine into a structure representative of
the input, we will now take advantage of the fact that <i>match</i>
returns lexemes.
We will convert all of the
parsing functions to return the structure that function has
recognized, in the form of a tree of lexemes. It is assumed the lexem
objects are outfitted with left and right pointers so that they can be
assembled into binary trees. Here is the updated <i>expression</i> function.
<br/>

<pre>
    function expression()
        {
        var tree;

        tree = primary();
        if (opPending())
            {
            var temp;
            temp = op(); 
            temp.left = tree;
            temp.right = expression();
            tree = temp;
            }

        return tree;
        }
</pre>

The <i>expression</i> function now returns a tree whose root, in the case of a
complex expression, is the operator and whose left and right subtrees hold
the left-hand side and the right-hand side of the binary operation,
respectively. In the case of a simple expression (primary only), the
tree returned by the primary function is returned directly. The <i>op</i> and
<i>primary</i> routines simply become:
<br/>

<pre>
    function op()
        {
        return match(ANYTHING); //type ANYTHING matches all operator types
        }

    function primary() 
        {
        var tree;

        if (check(VARIABLE)) 
            {
            tree = match(VARIABLE);
            }
        else if (check(NUMBER))
            {
            tree = match(NUMBER);
            }
        else if (check(OPAREN))
            {
            tree = match(OPAREN);
            tree.left = null;
            tree.right = expression();
            }
        else //unary minus
            {
            tree = match(MINUS);
            tree.type = UMINUS; //rename!
            tree.left = null;
            tree.right = primary();
            }

        return tree;
        }
</pre>

Note that the lexeme type in the unary minus case was renamed to reflect
that the MINUS sign was overloaded at the lexical level.

<h2>
 Building a pretty printer
<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

A pretty printer simply reformats the input. Since we've saved the input
and its structure in a parse tree, it is a relatively
simple task to regenerate
the original input. Recall that lexemes are objects that can hold any
kind of value in your language and that the component <i>ival</i> stores the
value of integer lexemes and that the component <i>sval</i> stores the value
of variable and string lexemes. One possible way of implementing the
pretty printer is through a switch statement that steps through all the
possible lexeme types:
<br/>

<pre>
    function prettyPrint(tree)
        {
        switch (tree.type)
            {
            case NUMBER   { print(tree.nval);}
            case VARIABLE { print(tree.sval); }
            case STRING   { print(&#39;\&quot;&#39;, tree.sval, &#39;\&quot;&#39;); }
            case OPAREN
                {
                print(&quot;(&quot;);
                prettyPrint(tree.right);
                print(&quot;)&quot;);
                }
            case UMINUS
                {
                print(&quot;-&quot;);
                print(tree.right);
                }
            case PLUS
                {
                prettyPrint(tree.left);
                print(&quot; + &quot;);
                prettyPrint(tree.right);
                }
            .
            .
            .
            else { print(&quot;bad expression!&quot;); }
            }
        }
</pre>

This pretty printer is pretty basic and not very pretty. In fact,
it prints an entire expression on a single line, regardless of its
size. More sophisticated pretty printers have additional arguments, the
most useful of which is an indentation level. However, getting a pretty
printer to print out beautiful looking code is a rather tedious process,
involving much trial and error.
