<!-- UNIT_SEQUENCE -->

Once you have developed an context-free grammar for your language, the
next task to build a recognizer for your language via recursive descent
parsing. A recognizer is a program which says whether the expressions
(sentences) in your source code are syntactically legal. A recursive
descent parser is composed of a set of parsing functions, each of which
derives from a rule in the grammar. Not all grammars are suitable for
recursive descent parsing. Suppose the grammar for your language is:
<br/>

<pre>
    expression : unary
               | expression operator expression

    operator : PLUS | MINUS | TIMES | DIVIDE

    unary : INTEGER
          | VARIABLE
          | VARIABLE OPAREN optExpressionList CPAREN
          | OPAREN expression CPAREN

    optExpressionList : expressionList | e

    expressionList : expression
                   | expression COMMA expressionList
</pre>

If a grammar rule is left-recursive, then the associated parsing function
can, in some cases, fall into an infinite recursive loop. For example,
the rule for <i>expression</i> is left-recursive (that is, in one branch of
<i>expression</i>, the first thing is <i>expression</i>) so we will need to transform
that rule to a right-recursive format. There is a formal technique for
dealing with immediately left-recursive rules such as expression. Given
a left recursive rule of the form:
<br/>

<pre>
    a : a x | b
</pre>

where <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are strings of terminals and non-terminals, an
equivalent pair of rules is:
<br/>

<pre>
    a : b r
    r : x r | e
</pre>

Performing such a transformation on the expression rule yields
<br/>

<pre>
    expression : unary expressionR

    expressionR : operator expression expressionR | e
</pre>

These two rules, neither of which is left-recursive, replace the original
expression rule. Unfortunately, the technique generates some non-intuitive
rules. In this particular case, there is a more intuitive approach. We
note that another way to look at the grammar rule:
<br/>

<pre>
    expression : unary
               | expression operator expression
</pre>

is that an expression is simply a number of primaries connected by
operators. Thus we can rewrite the rule either as:
<br/>

<pre>
    expression : unary
               | unary operator expression
</pre>

or:
<br/>

<pre>
    expression : unary
               | expression operator unary
</pre>

We choose the first rewrite since it is not left recursive.
<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, in both the formal and intuitive rewrite of the
left-recursive rule, we end up implementing a right associative
grammar. That is, expressions such as:
<br/>

<pre>
    a - b - c - d
</pre>

will be recognized as:
<br/>

<pre>
    (a - (b - (c - d)))
</pre>

which is contrary to the view of subtraction we have likely been taught
in grammar school. Does this mean that recursive descent parsing can
only be used for <i>right-associative</i> expressions? The answer is no,
but it will take an engineering trick to accomplish that goal (more on
associativity later). Transforming grammars
<br/>
<br/>
Once all left recursion is eliminated, there is a straight-forward
transformation from a grammar rule to a function which implements the
grammar rule:
<br/>

<ul>

<li>

 each <i>lhs</i> side of a rule becomes a function definition with the <i>lhs</i> as the name of the function - the body of the function corresponds to <i>rhs</i>
</li>

<li>

 in the body, each terminal on the <i>rhs</i> corresponds to a call to a function named match
</li>

<li>

 in the body, each non-terminal on the <i>rhs</i> corresponds to a call to the function named by that non-terminal
</li>

<li>

 in the body, different branches of the <i>rhs</i> correspond to calls to a function named check (or a pending function - more on that later)
</li>

</ul>


A small number of lexical helper functions will be needed though, two
of which are mentioned above . These helper functions are:
<br/>
<span class="indent">
<table>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left";> <b><i>function</i></b> </td><td style="text-align:left";> <b><i>purpose</i></b> </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left";> <i>advance</i> </td><td style="text-align:left";> move to the next lexeme in the input stream </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left";> <i>match</i> </td><td style="text-align:left";> insist that the current lexeme is of the given type</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left";> </td><td style="text-align:left";> - if it is, advance is called</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left";> </td><td style="text-align:left";> - otherwise an error is reported</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left";> <i>check</i> </td><td style="text-align:left";> check whether or not the current lexeme is of the given type</td>
</tr>
</table>


</span>

<br/>
They are consider lexical functions because they deal with the lexemes
that make up the input stream. Here is a recursive descent parser which
recognizes strings in the language specified by the above grammar. Note
that the parser just recognizes, it does not build up a parse tree. Also
note that good style insists that the grammar rule precede its associated
parsing function. Implementing grammars via recursive descent
<br/>
Let's implement the right associative grammar rule:
<br/>

<pre>
    expression : unary operator expression | unary
</pre>

as a recursive descent parsing function. Recall that each symbol to
the left of the colon is called a <i>non-terminal</i>. Each non-terminal
will correspond to a function. The right hand side of the rule,
which the non-terminal heads, will correspond to the body of the
function. Non-terminals on the right hand side correspond to a call to
the function associated with that non-terminal. Here is the function
corresponding to <i>expression</i>:
<br/>

<pre>
    function expression()
        {
        unary();
        if (operatorPending())
            {
            operator();
            expression();
            }
        }
</pre>

Since an expression can be two things, a <i>unary</i> or a <i>unary</i> followed
by an operator and then another expression, we use <i>operatorPending</i> to see
if an operator is indeed pending. The function operatorPending abstracts
a series of calls to check. If an operator is pending, then we know we
have the second version of expression.
<br/>
<br/>
Note that the function does not return anything. If the non-terminal
functions are written in this manner, the resulting program can recognize
sentences in the language, but cannot execute them. These types of
programs are known as language recognizers or grammar checkers. Later
we will use these functions to build parse trees and then manipulate
those parse trees.
<br/>
<br/>
For another example, consider the rule:
<br/>

<pre>
    unary : INTEGER
          | VARIABLE
          | VARIABLE OPAREN optEexpressionList CPAREN
          | OPAREN expression CPAREN
</pre>

Here is its implementation:
<br/>

<pre>
    function unary()
        {
        if (check(NUMBER))
            {
            advance();
            }
        else if (check(VARIABLE))
            {
            // two cases!
            advance();
            if (check(OPAREN))
                {
                advance();
                optArgumentList();
                match(CPAREN);
                }
            }
        else
            {
            match(OPAREN);
            expression();
            match(CPAREN);
            }
        }
</pre>

The function <i>advance</i> is used to advance the input to the next token
in the stream. The function match is used to ensure that the current
input token is the supplied terminal. If the input does not match, an
error is reported. If it does, then <i>advance</i> is called to move to the
next input token. In general, the function check and pending functions
are used to implement decision points in the grammar rule, the function
<i>advance</i> is used to skip past input that has already been analyzed, and
the function match is used to ensure that terminals appear in the input
in their proper places.
<br/>
<br/>
Note the close correspondence between the function <i>unary</i> and the
grammar rule headed by <i>unary</i>.
<br/>
<br/>
In summary, each grammar rule corresponds to a function. Each non-terminal
on the right-hand side corresponds to a function call to the function
associated with that non-terminal. Each terminal corresponds to a call to
match. Each "or" corresponds to a call to check or a pending function. It
is as simple as that.
<br/>
<br/>
Here is a complete parser for the set of grammar rules shown at the
very top of this page. The parser assumes that top-level expressions
are terminated with semicolons.
<br/>

<pre>
    function parse()
        {
        // Start symbol is expression, terminator is SEMI

        advance();
        expression();
        match(SEMI);
        }

    /////////// recursive descent parsing functions ///////////

    // expression : unary op expression | unary

    function expression()
        {
        unary();
        if (operatorPending())
            {
            operator();
            expression();
            }
        }

    // operator : PLUS | MINUS | TIMES | DIV

    function operator()
        {
        // must be an operator pending or would not have gotten here
        // use advance instead of match since we don&#39;t know exactly
        // which operator is pending

        advance();
        }

    // unary : INTEGER
    //         | VARIABLE
    //         | VARIABLE OPAREN optArgumentList CPAREN
    //         | OPAREN expression CPAREN

    function unary()
        {
        if (check(INTEGER))
            {
            match(INTEGER);
            }
        else if (check(VARIABLE))
            {
            advance();
            // two cases!
            if (check(OPAREN))
                {
                advance();
                optArgumentList();
                match(CPAREN);
                }
            }
        else // must be a parenthesized expression
            {
            match(OPAREN);
            expression();
            match(CPAREN);
            }
        }

    // optArgumentList : argumentList | empty

    function optArgumentList()
        {
        if (argumentListPending())
            {
            argumentList();
            }
        // else empty
        }

    // argumentLists: expression
    //              | expression COMMA argumentList

    function argumentList()
        {
        expression();
        if (check(COMMA))
            {
            match(COMMA);
            argumentList();
            }
        }


    ////////////// first set functions ///////////////

    function operatorPending()
        {
        return check(PLUS) || check(MINUS) || check(TIMES) || check(DIV);
        }

    function argumentListPending()
        {
        return expressionPending();
        }

    function expressionPending()
        {
        return unaryPending();
        }

    function unaryPending()
        {
        return check(INTEGER) || check(VARIABLE) || check(OPAREN);
        }

    /////////////// parser utility functions //////////////////

    function advance()
        {
        var old = Current;

        // get the next lexeme in the input stream

        Current = lex();

        return old;
        }

    function match(int type)
        {
        if (check(type))
            {
            return advance();
            }

        ParseException(&quot;Parse error: looking for %s, found %s instead\n&quot;,
        TypeToStr(type), Current.display());

        return null;
        }

    function check(int type)
        {
        return type == Current-&gt;type;
        }
</pre>

Notice how closely the implementations of the grammar rules follow
the rules themselves. Also, note that match is returning the matched
lexeme. This is in preparation for building parse trees.
