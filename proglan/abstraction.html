<h2>
 Data abstractions

<br/>
</h2><!-- section ENDED -->

The ability to glue up primitive data into more complex structures
allows us to place more complex meanings to data. A single number might
represent the temperature or length or some other scalar quantity, but
a pair of numbers may represent a rational number, a complex number,
a rectangle and so on. Since the cons operation gives us an easy way to
pair up numbers, let's use a cons object to represent a complex number.
<br/>

<pre>
    (define c (cons 4 5))
</pre>

Assuming for the moment that we will represent complex numbers using
the Cartesian coordinate system, the name c might refer to the complex
number <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow>	<mn>4</mn>	<mo>+</mo>	<mn>5</mn>	<mi>i</mi></mrow></math>. We can abstract this idea of creating complex numbers
using a function. Here is a function which creates complex numbers:
<br/>

<pre>
    (define (Complex real imag)
        (cons real imag)
        )
</pre>

Now we can use our constructor to make a number of different complex
numbers
<br/>

<pre>
    (define c1 (Complex 3 4))
    (define c2 (Complex 2 0))
    (define c3 (Complex 2 1))
</pre>

With this abstraction, we are now free to change the representation of a
complex number. For example, we could use a list representation instead,
as in
<br/>

<pre>
    (define (Complex real imag)
        (list real imag)
        )
</pre>

without having to change the way we create such numbers (via calls
to <i>Complex</i>).
<br/>
<br/>
Generally, it is necessary to extract the individual data items from a
data structure. For Complex objects and the cons object representation,
we can extract the real part using car and the imaginary part using cadr.
<br/>

<pre>
    (define r1 (car c1))
    (define i1 (cadr c1))
</pre>

Of course, this method of access is directly tied to the representation
of Complex objects. To overcome this limitation, we can abstract these
access functions, as in:
<br/>

<pre>
    (define (real cobj)
        (car obj)
        )

    (define (imag cobj)
        (cadr obj)
        )
</pre>

Now our application code is insulated from the internal representation. If
we change the representation of complex numbers, we only need to change
the constructor and the access functions. We can use other functions
which deal with complex numbers, such as printComplex:
<br/>

<pre>
    (define (printComplex cobj)
        (display (real cobj))
        (display &quot; + &quot;)
        (display (imag cobj))
        (display &quot;i&quot;)
        )
</pre>

Note that this &ldquo;higher level&rdquo; function,
because it uses the primitive
access functions, is not dependent upon the internal representation of
a complex number.
