As I sit here at the table
I can't seem to find my label
Where, oh where, where is my label
I just don't know

I hope I find it 'fore tomorrow
If I don't I'll have great sorrow
Then I might just have to borrow
One from a friend

Please just let me find that label
If I don't I won't be able
To know which one is my stable
That would be bad

I think I just found my label
Sitting right here on the table
Now I won't have any issue
Finding my stall

It looks just like any other
Think I bought it from your mother
Or maybe it was your brother
I couldn't tell
