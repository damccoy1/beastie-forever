Wake Up
Its fun
There's sunshine all around

Oh look
its them
My best friends in the world

Lets go
Lets run
The best times in the sun

Oh wait
I kid
Now lets go have some fun

-BREAK-

I see
So cool
A Man is selling kites

Lets fly
Lets Soar
A squirrel just stole our kite

Um guys
That squirrel
I don't think I like him

Alright
Thats it
That squirrel just flicked me off

CHORUS:
Sunshine and fun
Grass fields and Ice Cream
Bring out the best team
Cause nothing's better than today

Whats that
I see
The squirrel has some friends

Alright
Its time
Its us or the rodents

And now
Its time
For the moral of the story

Think twice
Before
You mess with a squirrel that steals kites



CHORUS X2
Sunshine and fun
Grass fields and Ice Creamxgrht
Bring out the best team
Cause nothing's better than today
