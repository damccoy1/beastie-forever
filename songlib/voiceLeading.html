<h1><a name="id2">Voice leading</a></h1><p>
The <i><b>songlib</b></i>&#32;system can automatically choose inversions
of a chord so that the travel of the notes from the previous
chord to the new chord are minimized.
Voice leading is under the control of the
the <i>setVoiceLeading</i> and <i>getVoiceLeading</i> functions:
</p>
<pre>
    int setVoiceLeading(int mode);
    int getVoiceLeading(void);
</pre>
<p>The <i>setVoiceLeading</i> function sets the voice leading mode and returns the
previous setting.  Currently there is only one mode (more are planned), so
to turn on voice leading, pass a 1 to <i>setVoiceLeading</i>.
The <i>getVoiceLeading</i> function returns the current voice leading mode.
</p>
<p>Voice leading works for all chord functions, including modal chords.
However, there are some limitations. Inversions are chosen only if the
number of notes in the previous chord equals the number of notes in
the new chord. Moreover, in figuring minimal distances, the lowest note
of the previous chord is compared to the first note of the new chord,
the second lowest note of the previous chord is compared to the second note of
the new chord, and so on. If the
new chord's notes are arranged from
high to low, then travel will be minimized between the low note of
the previous chord and the high note of the new chord, and so on.
</p>
<p>In choosing inversions, the first note is only allowed to move up an
octave, while the last note is only allowed to move down an octave.
Notes in between are allowed to move up or down an octave in order
to minimize note travel.
